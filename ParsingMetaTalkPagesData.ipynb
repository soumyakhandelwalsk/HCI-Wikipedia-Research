Roosevelt is one of the most important president in the history of US. Shaka is an important king in Africa but it is not more important than others African kings of the period (Usman dan Fodio, Omar Saidou Tall...). Regarding Ayn Rand, she\\'s an infuential essayist in the US but her theory (laissez-faire, importance of individual rights...) was better described by others philosophers or economists. And Sartre developped original theories (existentialism...) was a key figure of the philosophy of the 20th century. Best regards, --[[User:Nicolas Eynaud|Nicolas Eynaud]] ([[User talk:Nicolas Eynaud|talk]]) 08:07, 6 February 2020 (UTC)\\n:: About bolding/unbolding changes, I think some propositions are very strange. For exemple, Guereva is an important figure but it\\'s hard to considere him more important than Lenin. And it\\'s the same with Money/Currency, Toy/Chess, Hinduism/Spanish, Christopher Columbus/Akira Kurosawa... Best regards, --[[User:Nicolas Eynaud|Nicolas Eynaud]] ([[User talk:Nicolas Eynaud|talk]]) 08:13, 6 February 2020 (UTC)\\n\\n:I oppose the unargumented additions and removals. — [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 10:12, 6 February 2020 (UTC)\\n::Disagree on most of the bolds/unbolds. Strongly disagree on the removal of Roosevelt/Sartre. Shaka would be a good add, and despite the suggestion that Fodio and Tall are equal in prominence (they\\'re not, he\\'s clearly the most prominent pre-modern age African leader, with only Musa I of Mali coming close). Either way we should have atleast one of the pre-modern age African leaders listed, he is arguably more important than Guevara who doesn\\'t stack up to Fidel Castro and i\\'d even list Toussaint Louverture over both Guevera or Castro as his impact had more of a revolutionary impact on the world than small island Cuba. Guevara and Castro have to compete with Ho Chi Minh too in 20th century revolutionary prominence, so Guevara would be the weakest entry point for a pre-modern age African figure like Shaka. But we don\\'t list African cultural figures like Fela Kuti or Chinua Achebe, and we don\\'t cover ANY ancient pharaoh like Ramesses II, which would be a better add than Shaka anyway, but both would fit. (yes i know, Naguib Mahfouz is listed but considering we list Abu Nuwas, i\\'d prefer a swap of Mahfouz with Achebe). \\n\\n::Now Ayn Rand would only be vital as a writer, her philosophical achievements would be below many other social scientists. But we don\\'t have ANY women writers, which is a BIG miss, Sappho, Murasaki Shikibu, Jane Austen, Mary Wollstonecraft, Agatha Christie, Virginia Woolf, Selma Lagerlöf, Emily Dickinson, George Eliot or Mary Shelley would all come before Rand and atleast one should be listed.\\n\\n::Here are my other suggestions that could be good additions in my opinion, to add to the spirit of this thread\\n\\n::1. Marlene Dietrich could be swapped for Anna Pavlova, since we already list two other actresses and Pavlova covers a more underrepresented field (dance) and Ballet has a longer European art history than German film (two American actresses would be too much, so i assume she\\'s listed for her German work). Maria Callas would be the other choice for a older European artform like artistic singing/opera to be covered among popular singers, while increasing women.  Or even adding Coco Chanel, for another undercovered area.  \\n::2. Wright brothers, Cai Lun, Nicéphore Niépce, Alexander Graham Bell, Auguste and Louis Lumière, Alessandro Volta all could have a place and also Hippocrates or Andreas Vesalius, since medicine is a vital field and we could do with another other than Pasteur. Fibonacci, Ptolemy and Francis Bacon would be good too.\\n::3. Japan\\'s a vital enough country to list a political leader like Hirohito (especially if we have De Gaulle) , Emperor Meiji or Oda Nobunaga\\n::4. William the Conqueror should be listed\\n::5. Henrik Ibsen/Brothers Grimm could be another add - Ibsen is more important than Hans Christian Andersen\\n::6. one of the Beatles/Louis Armstrong/Elvis/Édith Piaf should be bold instead of Stravinsky, so atleast one non classical composer is bolded. One person from directors/screenwriters/actors should be bolded too, probably Chaplin or Kurosawa or Hitchcock. \\n::7. Bruce Lee and Pelé represent culture figures that are non European/American and would be a good counter. Someone like Bruce Lee holds as much weight in Asia itself as Marilyn Monroe does America. Pele is alive and i get that we probably shouldn\\'t list alive people, but he\\'d be our one South American culture figure and arguably soccer has just as much of a impact around the world as major form of arts like  American film, of which we list 7 representatives. \\n::8. Peter Paul Rubens should be swapped for Claude Monet, who had much more of a impact on modern art than Rubens, if we had to list a Flemish artist i\\'d prefer Jan van Eyck over Rubens for time period diversity. \\n::9. I don\\'t see why we should have Al-Ghazali over Ali and i don\\'t see why we need too Buddhists and i would remove Nagarjuna for Maimonides. \\n::10. Amelia Earhart could be a good add to add women to explorers and to cover aviators. Florence Nightingale would be a another good add. Emmeline Pankhurst wouldn\\'t be out of place with MLK listed.\\n\\n::Anyway just thought i\\'d offer my thoughts as a outside observer, i disagree with most of these proposed edits and offered up some of my own people who could be decent picks on the list, thanks. [[User:GuzzyG|GuzzyG]] ([[User talk:GuzzyG|talk]]) 19:28, 9 February 2020 (UTC)\\n\\n:::The number of biographies (204) is too high. In my opinion for example Matisse, Rubens, Velázquez, Warhol, Dvořák, Cartier, Dietrich, Spielberg, Berners-Lee, Joule, Chomsky, Che and Hegel can be removed. I can support adding Ramses, Sappho, Murasaki Shikibu (Genji is currently listed), Jane Austen, Hippocrates, Louis Pasteur or Claude Monet. I don\\'t think that the list needs any dancer, opera singer or aviator. --[[User:Thi|Thi]] ([[User talk:Thi|talk]]) 14:46, 10 February 2020 (UTC)\\n:::: {{Ping|Thi}} I would support al these remivals which yku suggested. But as for additions, for now I can support just Pastoue as number of biograpbies should be much lower. 12:16, 10 February 2021 (UTC)\\n*\\'\\'\\'Reasoning behind removing Roosevelt.\\'\\'\\' {{re|Nicolas Eynaud|GuzzyG}} Of the 39 political leaders, \\'\\'4\\'\\' are United States Presidents and \\'\\'5\\'\\' are WW2-era World Leaders. FDR sits at the intersection of \\'\\'both groups\\'\\', and I\\'m sorry but the point of this list is not to find the most impactful leaders but to provide a variety of coverage. Replacing him with Shaka only makes logical sense as he is one of the most famous \\'\\'African\\'\\' leaders in history (Nelson Mandela is pretty lonely).<br /><s>\\'\\'\\'Removal of Jean-Paul Sartre.\\'\\'\\' To be honest, I don\\'t care how it happens, but have way to many French philosophers on that list, and somehow do not have a \\'\\'\\'single woman.\\'\\'\\' If I suggested we axe Voltaire, people would\\'ve rioted. If I suggested we axe Descartes, the people would have rioted. If I suggested Rousseau or Beauvoir... same thing. The French don\\'t have a monopoly on philosophy, and I picked the most well known woman philosopher I could think of.</s><br />\\'\\'\\'Boldings.\\'\\'\\' Besides maybe Guevara, no one has articulated any actual reasoning behind disagreeing with my proposed boldings. I clearly state at the beginning that the list should reflect a \\'\\'diversity of content\\'\\' which \\'\\'adequately reflects the archetypes of each list\\'\\' not what is or is not the most \"important\" of the list. That\\'s why I would prefer we have Che Guevara over Fidel Castro; we already have too many dictators on the list and not enough revolutionaries. <br />I hope what I am saying makes more sense in context. &#8211;<span style=\"font-family:CG Times\">[[User:MJL|<span style=\"color:black\">MJL</span>]]&thinsp;[[User talk:MJL|‐\\'\\'\\'Talk\\'\\'\\'‐]]<sup>[[Special:CentralAuth/MJL|☖]]</sup></span> 00:04, 11 February 2020 (UTC)\\n\\n::No offense, {{u|MJL}}, but your reasoning on replacing Sartre makes no sense at all.

On enwiki\\'s vital articles list, they have a formal procedure. For example, how do we know if we have consensus to add or remove something? Should we have a consensus on what to bold and what not to bold? Some things to think out.

However, to we have consensus from \"vrious diffrent users\" for \"ballanced list with global perspective\" I think we could introduce rule that one user can give just \"five proposals for removal per week\" and \"five proposals for addition per week\" (votings, could be doing ad infinitum) . Most active Wikipedians in that project should be welcomable for users who do not visit that page so often. This project certainly should not be dominated by handful of regulars user. This is for sure better to analyse twenty swap proposals from twenty various users than twenty from one person which can be combative (for example twenty swap proposals in biography, menwhile someone disagree the current quota is good), not? [[User:Dawid2009|Dawid2009]] ([[User talk:Dawid2009|talk]]) 10:09, 23 April 2021 (UTC)\\n \\t\\n: As for that procedure on Enhlish Wikipedia (I am active Wikipedian on Eglish Wikipedia too). This is formal voting proces which have been work well. Honestly I like that process but on the other hand later or ealier in practice there are four disdvantages 1 this procedure in practice does not work when list is very not stable and have many mistakes which could be improved by WP:Bold (for example list of 50 000 articles on ENwiki, list of 10 000 articles on metwiki and even list of 1000 articles on metawiki as well IMHO). Firstly we should \\'\\'\\'wait\\'\\'\\' when metalist will be bit more stable. 2When there are very few participants in the project, there are no objections how long discussion should be openen before making closure, 30 days is usually too short time in practice to gain estailished consensus 3 On English Wikipedia this procedure does not go on pair with key Wikipedia\\'s rule  [[en:Wikipedia:Involved|WP:involved]], most discussions are closed by nominators/supporters even though in every other place on Wikipedia this is doing by uninvolved person. 4 Disadvantage of the point 2 and disadvantage of the point 3 sometimes cause that there are beurocracy games there. Bot can archive ongoing discussion which was not closed by any user ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=909718416]). Or WP:Involved user can close the discussion during the same time when make last decidive vote in the proposal (like here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Vital_articles&diff=1019086054&oldid=1019078637], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=896185035], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Vital_articles/Archive_15#New_rule_to_wait_a_week_after_a_vote_has_received_enough_to_pass]), not giving time for opposers to keep oppose vote. This is my opinion about process on ENwiki. Like I said it work very well but probably the biggest disadvantage of that procedure is ignoring [[en:WP\"Involved|WP:involved rule]] because of when the rule WP:Involved is ignored, most active users have more influence for discussion than users who do not have so many time to check discussion regularry and do not bother to close the discussion.

In my view Fairy Tale should have one representative based disussion where someone nominated Fairy Tale for removal on English Wikipedia. H C Andersen is by far more vital than Grimm Brothers as he is the most translated author from 19th century (yes, he is THE one), the most popular European writer in China (yes, probably more than Shakespeare. While readers rather not search about Fairy Tales on the Wikipedia then there so many reliable sources for that fact on the Internet. There are even sources H C Andersen is the most popular forgein writer there) and represent Scandinavia area better than Grimm Brothers Germany.

Although some of the changes are uncontroversial (for example, removing Vatican City and Singapore), I am not sure more biographies is what these lists need. Keeping it around 200 is fine, if all of these countries are removed, they should be replaced with other countries, I would suggest ones missing by population.

If it weren\\'t for him, Catholicism would still exist in England. I would be OK with Henry VIII added alongside Louis XIV. Could you elaborate on why swapping Marxism with Genocide would not be a good idea? Are you against both the removal and the addition or one of them? I think it would be redundant to list Marxism when we already list Communism. Genocide seems to be an important topic around the world considering that all parts of the world have experienced it.

Louis XIV is, at least, the longest reigning monarch; if we were adding all founders of different religious groups, then we’re already lacking [[:w:Guru Nanak|Guru Nanak]], for example. As for Genocide/Marxism swap, I just think it’s another controversially worded swap, I support having Genocide article in the list.\\n \\n::: As for why Marxism and Communism do not cover each other, it’s because Marxism is (maybe wrongly) put in ideologies when it’s more of an economic theory. As the current set of topics stands (with Capitalism from economics added to this list), I think it is balanced, maybe something else needs to be found to make place for Genocide article (suggestion: Golf?).
