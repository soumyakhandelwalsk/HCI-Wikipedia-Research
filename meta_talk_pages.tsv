Bolded items should best reflect the category of article they are in and not primarily be known for other reasons. It also should not be too West-centric.

Unless someone pings me with an objection in the next few days, I am going to make the following changes to this list:
 Unbolding:
 Christopher Columbus
 Alan Turing
 Thomas Edison
 Moses
 Money
 International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
 British Empire
 Capital punishment
 Toy
 Vladimir Lenin
 Hinduism

 Bolding:
 Akira Kurosawa
 Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi
 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 Abraham
 Currency
 Fruit
 Delhi
 Mecca
 Chess
 Che Guevara
 Spanish

 Adding:
 Shaka
 Ayn Rand

 Removing:
 Franklin D. Roosevelt
 Jean-Paul Sartre

  About the changes, Franklin D. Roosevelt is one of the most important president in the history of US. Shaka is an important king in Africa but it is not more important than others African kings of the period (Usman dan Fodio, Omar Saidou Tall...). Regarding Ayn Rand, she's an infuential essayist in the US but her theory (laissez-faire, importance of individual rights...) was better described by others philosophers or economists. And Sartre developped original theories (existentialism...) was a key figure of the philosophy of the 20th century. Best regards, --"

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have	0	 Going to make some changes 	4	GuzzyG	19:28, 9 February 2020 (UTC)	"Disagree on most of the bolds/unbolds. Strongly disagree on the removal of Roosevelt/Sartre. Shaka would be a good add, and despite the suggestion that Fodio and Tall are equal in prominence (they're not, he's clearly the most prominent pre-modern age African leader, with only Musa I of Mali coming close). Either way we should have atleast one of the pre-modern age African leaders listed, he is arguably more important than Guevara who doesn't stack up to Fidel Castro and i'd even list Toussaint Louverture over both Guevera or Castro as his impact had more of a revolutionary impact on the world than small island Cuba. Guevara and Castro have to compete with Ho Chi Minh too in 20th century revolutionary prominence, so Guevara would be the weakest entry point for a pre-modern age African figure like Shaka. But we don't list African cultural figures like Fela Kuti or Chinua Achebe, and we don't cover ANY ancient pharaoh like Ramesses II, which would be a better add than Shaka anyway, but both would fit. (yes i know, Naguib Mahfouz is listed but considering we list Abu Nuwas, i'd prefer a swap of Mahfouz with Achebe). 

Now Ayn Rand would only be vital as a writer, her philosophical achievements would be below many other social scientists. But we don't have ANY women writers, which is a BIG miss, Sappho, Murasaki Shikibu, Jane Austen, Mary Wollstonecraft, Agatha Christie, Virginia Woolf, Selma Lagerlöf, Emily Dickinson, George Eliot or Mary Shelley would all come before Rand and atleast one should be listed.

Here are my other suggestions that could be good additions in my opinion, to add to the spirit of this thread

1. Marlene Dietrich could be swapped for Anna Pavlova, since we already list two other actresses and Pavlova covers a more underrepresented field (dance) and Ballet has a longer European art history than German film (two American actresses would be too much, so i assume she's listed for her German work). Maria Callas would be the other choice for a older European artform like artistic singing/opera to be covered among popular singers, while increasing women.  Or even adding Coco Chanel, for another undercovered area.  
2. Wright brothers, Cai Lun, Nicéphore Niépce, Alexander Graham Bell, Auguste and Louis Lumière, Alessandro Volta all could have a place and also Hippocrates or Andreas Vesalius, since medicine is a vital field and we could do with another other than Pasteur. Fibonacci, Ptolemy and Francis Bacon would be good too.
3. Japan's a vital enough country to list a political leader like Hirohito (especially if we have De Gaulle) , Emperor Meiji or Oda Nobunaga
4. William the Conqueror should be listed
5. Henrik Ibsen/Brothers Grimm could be another add - Ibsen is more important than Hans Christian Andersen
6. one of the Beatles/Louis Armstrong/Elvis/Édith Piaf should be bold instead of Stravinsky, so atleast one non classical composer is bolded. One person from directors/screenwriters/actors should be bolded too, probably Chaplin or Kurosawa or Hitchcock. 
7. Bruce Lee and Pelé represent culture figures that are non European/American and would be a good counter. Someone like Bruce Lee holds as much weight in Asia itself as Marilyn Monroe does America. Pele is alive and i get that we probably shouldn't list alive people, but he'd be our one South American culture figure and arguably soccer has just as much of a impact around the world as major form of arts like  American film, of which we list 7 representatives. 
8. Peter Paul Rubens should be swapped for Claude Monet, who had much more of a impact on modern art than Rubens, if we had to list a Flemish artist i'd prefer Jan van Eyck over Rubens for time period diversity. 
9. I don't see why we should have Al-Ghazali over Ali and i don't see why we need too Buddhists and i would remove Nagarjuna for Maimonides. 
10. Amelia Earhart could be a good add to add women to explorers and to cover aviators. Florence Nightingale would be a another good add. Emmeline Pankhurst wouldn't be out of place with MLK listed.

Anyway just thought i'd offer my thoughts as a outside observer, i disagree with most of these proposed edits and offered up some of my own people who could be decent picks on the list, thanks."

In my opinion for example Matisse, Rubens, Velázquez, Warhol, Dvořák, Cartier, Dietrich, Spielberg, Berners-Lee, Joule, Chomsky, Che and Hegel can be removed. I can support adding Ramses, Sappho, Murasaki Shikibu (Genji is currently listed), Jane Austen, Hippocrates, Louis Pasteur or Claude Monet. I don't think that the list needs any dancer, opera singer or aviator. --

Reasoning behind removing Roosevelt.  Of the 39 political leaders, 4 are United States Presidents and 5 are WW2-era World Leaders. FDR sits at the intersection of both groups, and I'm sorry but the point of this list is not to find the most impactful leaders but to provide a variety of coverage. Replacing him with Shaka only makes logical sense as he is one of the most famous African leaders in history (Nelson Mandela is pretty lonely).Removal of Jean-Paul Sartre. To be honest, I don't care how it happens, but have way to many French philosophers on that list, and somehow do not have a single woman. If I suggested we axe Voltaire, people would've rioted. If I suggested we axe Descartes, the people would have rioted. If I suggested Rousseau or Beauvoir... same thing. The French don't have a monopoly on philosophy, and I picked the most well known woman philosopher I could think of.Boldings. Besides maybe Guevara, no one has articulated any actual reasoning behind disagreeing with my proposed boldings. I clearly state at the beginning that the list should reflect a diversity of content which adequately reflects the archetypes of each list not what is or is not the most ""important"" of the list. That's why I would prefer we have Che Guevara over Fidel Castro; we already have too many dictators on the list and not enough revolutionaries. I hope what I am saying makes more sense in context. –"

On enwiki's vital articles list, they have a formal procedure. For example, how do we know if we have consensus to add or remove something? Should we have a consensus on what to bold and what not to bold? Some things to think out. There could be a slower response to this one since this isn't as actively watched as enwiki's vital articles.
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have	4	 Additions and removals 	1	Dawid2009	10:09, 23 April 2021 (UTC)	"  Your open discussion at Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have#Creating a better list is probably the most helpful and best way to improve this list. However, to we have consensus from ""vrious diffrent users"" for ""ballanced list with global perspective"" I think we could introduce rule that one user can give just ""five proposals for removal per week"" and ""five proposals for addition per week"" (votings, could be doing ad infinitum) . Most active Wikipedians in that project should be welcomable for users who do not visit that page so often. This project certainly should not be dominated by handful of regulars user. This is for sure better to analyse twenty swap proposals from twenty various users than twenty from one person which can be combative (for example twenty swap proposals in biography, menwhile someone disagree the current quota is good), not?"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have	4	 Additions and removals 	2	Dawid2009	10:09, 23 April 2021 (UTC)	 As for that procedure on Enhlish Wikipedia (I am active Wikipedian on Eglish Wikipedia too). This is formal voting proces which have been work well. Honestly I like that process but on the other hand later or ealier in practice there are four disdvantages 1 this procedure in practice does not work when list is very not stable and have many mistakes which could be improved by WP:Bold (for example list of 50 000 articles on ENwiki, list of 10 000 articles on metwiki and even list of 1000 articles on metawiki as well IMHO). Firstly we should wait when metalist will be bit more stable. 2When there are very few participants in the project, there are no objections how long discussion should be openen before making closure, 30 days is usually too short time in practice to gain estailished consensus 3 On English Wikipedia this procedure does not go on pair with key Wikipedia's rule  WP:involved, most discussions are closed by nominators/supporters even though in every other place on Wikipedia this is doing by uninvolved person. 4 Disadvantage of the point 2 and disadvantage of the point 3 sometimes cause that there are beurocracy games there. Bot can archive ongoing discussion which was not closed by any user (). Or WP:Involved user can close the discussion during the same time when make last decidive vote in the proposal (like here , , ), not giving time for opposers to keep oppose vote. This is my opinion about process on ENwiki. Like I said it work very well but probably the biggest disadvantage of that procedure is ignoring WP:involved rule because of when the rule WP:Involved is ignored, most active users have more influence for discussion than users who do not have so many time to check discussion regularry and do not bother to close the discussion.

The enwiki's vital article list is more structured when it comes to deciding if an article should be added or removed.

In my view Fairy Tale should have one representative based disussion where someone nominated Fairy Tale for removal on English Wikipedia. H C Andersen is by far more vital than Grimm Brothers as he is the most translated author from 19th century (yes, he is THE one), the most popular European writer in China (yes, probably more than Shakespeare. While readers rather not search about Fairy Tales on the Wikipedia then there so many reliable sources for that fact on the Internet. There are even sources H C Andersen is the most popular forgein writer there) and represent Scandinavia area better than Grimm Brothers Germany.

What makes ""Eastern Orthodox Church"" more important to write a article in Amharic for than Chinese Buddhism? One of the many reasons listing regional religions that are offshoots off a major one is bad for this ""world"" list."

 Henry VIII was definitely not inconsequential. If it weren't for him, Catholicism would still exist in England. I would be OK with Henry VIII added alongside Louis XIV. Could you elaborate on why swapping Marxism with Genocide would not be a good idea? Are you against both the removal and the addition or one of them?

As for Genocide/Marxism swap, I just think it’s another controversially worded swap, I support having Genocide article in the list.
 
 As for why Marxism and Communism do not cover each other, it’s because Marxism is (maybe wrongly) put in ideologies when it’s more of an economic theory. As the current set of topics stands (with Capitalism from economics added to this list), I think it is balanced, maybe something else needs to be found to make place for Genocide article (suggestion: Golf?). stjn[ru] 16:02, 21 April 2021 (UTC)

If it is a problem that there are two concepts, instead Square could be replaced by :en:Transfinite number, though a general article is not that useful. --

 Behavior 

I accidentally found the article on :wikipedia:behavior. I sincerly do not find a translation to any of the Ripuarian languages. Once every few months, I try to pick a missing topic and write a Ripuarian stub or better for it. For ""behaviour"" I believe, it would have to be a disambiguation, but of a non-word.

We have a bunch of possible translations for behaviour. The English version of the article says: ""Behavior … refers to the actions or reactions of an object or organism, usually in relation to the environment. Behavior can be conscious or unconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.""
Well said. This is a wide field, and some of our specific translations (briefly) are:
  - Social behavior, or conduct, of humans (and sometimes domestizided animal and pets)
  - similar, but seen from a different viewpoint, also well-behavedness
  - willfull action
  - unconscious involuntary reaction
  - obedient behaviour (also including drill, and (possibly unwillfull) subordinaton)
  - listening, including obedience, and reactive or responsive behaviour
  - another set of flavours of obedience
  - willfull treatment or mistreatment of subordinates or dependants, pestering, etc.
  - to act, both consciously and unconsciously, visibly, in a noted way.
  - to manually do something, to handle, etc. (There are dozens of excessively more specific words describing human (but not necessarily only human) handling, and similar activities. They all comprise some sort of behaviour)
I'll stop here. The list is by far not complete. We lack a concept, and a word for it, summarizing all these interesting aspects into a topic such as ""behavior"". If we talk on ""behavior"" as in ""behaviorism"", we use loanwords. Those are, of course, much more specific than their originals.

One of the downside of the possible translatons is that they are not very systematic. Mostly, we cannot take one ot the qualifiers of the English description and then have, say, two translations. ""Behaviour of an organism"" and ""behaviour of an object"", do not translate either. So, we cannot easily make a list, and say: the sum of all this is behavior, anything else is not. It would be too fuzzy.

There are lots of afterthoughts. The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis comes to mind, and more philosophical questions like whether or not a concept, such as behavior, is useful and valid, even if a language has no word for it; and can people who lack the word indeed not use the associated concept in their thoughts, as Wittgenstein suggests?

Likely, there are more samples of words missing for translations to various languages. I just wanted to exemplify one a little bit, giving some background data. --"

This is a problem because in modern times, recent events have caused the population to skyrocket in some areas, and shrink in others, compared to the numbers you would get by plotting their populations in accordance with history.

To someone living in the Punjab or in Funan, Bach, Picasso and certainly Nightingale are irrelevant. I have been thinking that if the result is so skewed, it could be because even the classification is. For example, for two of the most important cultural worlds, the Chinese (China, Japan, Corea) and the Muslim (Arab and Persian cultures)  the most important art is not painting or even music, (arguably) it's calligraphy. There is not a single calligrapher in the list. It is just an example, but I think it is a good an example of what I mean.
To Meldor: you are right, we should not equal 'population=importance', but what I have shown are very extreme differences. If we accept them just like that, we are implicitly accepting that people outside of Europe are less intelligent, creative, etc. (see :w:en:Eurocentrism)
To Almafeta: Asia has always been the most populated continent. Europe was actually relatively unimportant compared to Asia until the 18th century. The continents are counted geographically. If the table was made based on cultures, the results would probably be even worse.
I'm just trying to raise the awareness that maybe we should take more into account cultures outside the Western and continents outside Europe.

Hangul is considered important because it was probably the most rationally planned alphabet.  A Korean emperor decided to switch from Chinese characters to an alphabet c. 1400.  He created a commission to do this, and the result promoted literacy in pre-modern Korea.  It also helped Koreans pioneer the printing press.  However, Tamil is also remarkable.  I know less about it, but the Tamil language itself is the oldest continuous written language in the world, since c. 200 AD.  All other written languages have changed in some way (i.e., Classical Chinese, wenyan, to vernacular Chinese, baihua).  Needless to say, native Tamil speakers need extensive education to learn how to read or even understand the news. I don't know anything about the Tamil alphabet or how it developed. I'll put it this way: as a language, Tamil is of great interest, whereas Hangul is of interest as an alphabet."

As the creator of Hangul, he was one of the first modern linguists, describing the phonology and grammar of his language and writing a dictionary in an age where all the learned classes learned Chinese.  More than that, he is credited with a good number of inventions, feverently supported technology and literacy, was an author of several classic works, and was a notable military leader in his own right.  I'm not quite sure if Hangul is in the top 1000 most important articles (though it definately belongs in the top 10'000), but I think Sejong the Great may deserve a place.

I've also had a serious interest (linguistic and otherwise) in numerous other cultures.

This article is 80-90% western European/American, even though these populations are less than 10% of the world population and were probably less than that throughout most of world history.  It's also important to remember that this list is a model for wikipedias in other (minor) languages, most of which will also be non-western languages (e.g., the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia).  For example, African language wikipedias should certainly have some major Islamic figures.

It's good that most of these articles are about general topics, such as ""biology,"" which are less culturally biased.  And, it is inevitable that this list be SOMEWHAT Eurocentric and even Anglocentric, because the world is that way right now (and most Egyptians are not too familiar with China, for example, but they know the US). However, this list is very extreme.  Even the non-Europeans that are there are present because they are known in the West.  Historical importance should matter more. 

The following are my (annotated) suggestions for the article.  If you are American or European, you probably haven't heard of many of these, but neither do many mainland Chinese know Helen Keller, Herodotus, or St. Francis. 

Thinkers 
Zhu Xi (12th c. Neo-Confucian, philosopher of the qi) 
Ibn Khaldun (c. 1400 Muslim historian and sociologist) 
Maimonides (12th c. Andalusian-Jewish theologian) 
Chanakya (4th-3rd c. BCE Indian political thinker) 

Authors (Extremely Eurocentric.  Why are there six ancient Greek and Latin authors, but one Chinese and no Indians, from all periods?  Literature is certainly one field in which European never had a monopoly, not even in the 19th c.  Since these are so many writers, I may hold off on a couple, though, e.g. Ghalib) 
Cao Xueqin (18th c. Chinese author of Dream of the Red Chamber) 
Kalidasa (5th c. Sanskrit ""Shakespeare"") 
Ferdowsi (10th c. Persian/Iranian national poet, should probably replace Omar Khayyam, who is mainly famous in the West) 
Lu Xun (20th c. Chinese writer) 
Chinua Achebe (20th c. African novelist) 
Ghalib (18th c. Urdu poet) 
Rabindranath Tagore (19th-20th c. Bengali writer) 

Explorers (the idea of an Explorer is possibly Eurocentric... what about ""Explorers and Travelers""?) 
Ibn Battuta (14th c. Moroccan world traveler) 

Artists and architects (All of those on the current list worked in the West.) 
Sinan (16th c. Ottoman imperial architect) 
Hokusai (19th c. Japanese painter) 

Musicians  (All western again.  Must they all be white classical composers?  I hardly think Jimi Hendrix is the only significant non-white musician.) 
Miles Davis 
Umm Kalthoum (Everything breathing Egyptian/Arab knows her) 
Amir Khusro (13th c. Sufi poet and Indian classical musician) 

Scientists 
Avicenna should be put here (and Ibn Khaldun takes his place among the Thinkers) 
-On the whole, this category should be more Eurocentric than others, because Westerners have been so dominant in the science of recent centuries.  However, I'm not familiar with the history of Chinese science, and there should definitely be Chinese scientists on this list (e.g., Su Song?).

Prehistory and ancient world (Current list is fully Euro/Mediterranean centric) 
Han Dynasty 
Gupta Empire 

Political Leaders 
Harun al-Rashid (who is the greatest Islamic caliph, even famous in the West from 1001 Nights!) 
Ashoka (Greatest Indian Buddhist monarch) 
Taizong (Tang emperor) 
Suleiman the Magnificent (Most powerful Ottoman sultan) 
(I'm happy that Akbar the Great and Tamerlane are already included here.  This list is easier to make less Eurocentric, it seems.) 

Revolutionaries (This category is very weak.  Truly important revolutionaries were generally also political leaders.  Couldn't these figures be put under ""political leaders""?  And I don't think Mother Theresa is necessary for, say, the Hausa wikipedia.) 
Rosa Luxemburg was a more important revolutionary than a thinker - which is where she is now - and more significant than Emma Goldman and Florence Nightingale, who are Anglocentric picks)

(A couple other possibilities overall: Ibn Hanbal [Muslim theologian], Chandragupta II [Indian monarch of the Gupta dynasty], Xuanzang [Chinese Buddhist traveler], Ibn abd al-Wahhab [Saudi theologian], Kabir [Hindi poet], Sundiata Keita [founder of the Mali empire], Hong Xiuquan [Taiping rebel], al-Mutannabi [most popular Arabic poet], etc.  Very unfortunately, some of these world-historical figures are not even well covered in English, so I will leave them out.)

I can very much justify these figures in terms of deletion of other Eurocentric figures.  Ibn Khaldun is more significant than Herodotus, let alone Giordano Bruno.  The Wahhabi movement (of Saudi Arabia) is far more influential than Francis of Assisi, especially today (and the excuse for the Eurocentrism of this list is that the West is more influential today).  Harun al-Rashid is far more significant than Mussolini, Ben-Gurion, or Bismarck.  Suleiman was more significant than Charlemagne (whose empire was an impoverished corner of the world at the time).  Kalidasa is far more significant than Jose Saramango.  And so on.

Those ""activists"" at the end are somewhat dubious.  Apparently the goal is to increase the number of women, but that seems to be happening at the expense of non-white peoples, who were in fact extraordinarily significant in world history.  Florence Nightingale was not.

Again, I'm not trying to radically change the list, just to make it slightly less Eurocentric.  I don't know much about sub-saharan Africa, and Africa's lack of written culture prior to colonialism probably makes it harder to include historical figures from that region.  Nonetheless, the near total lack of African and Southeast Asian figures on this list is still a problem.  And where are the black Americans?

I am going to wait a bit for a response, but I will start (slowly) adding these figures to the list soon."

Some people you mentioned were previously in the list but were pruned out. The biography section was huge compared with the other sections and greatly reduced some months ago. The best way to keep the list at a 1000 articles is mention who you want to replace for each article you want to add. --MarsRover 05:54, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

OK, I did start a bit.  I removed Sappho, Henrik Ibsen, Horace, and Omar Khayyam.  Omar Khayyam was easy, because he is Persian, and Ferdowsi's Shahnama is the Persian national epic.  Khayyam is mainly well-known in the West as a poet because of Fitzgerald's (inaccurate) translation.  Persian culture is well-known in India and the Islamic world, and the Shahnama is very much beloved in those regions too; I put the epic under poetry.  Sappho and Horace had to be removed because of an excess of Greek/Latin works.  I can't imagine that non-western readers would want so many before other worthy writers (I've reduced it to 4 from 6).  It's much better to add two Indian writers, Kalidasa and Tagore, since India was previously unrepresented.  Tagore is the Bengali national writer (and the first Asian Nobel Prize winner), and Kalidasa is considered the greatest Sanskrit writer - Sanskrit being the language of India for thousands of years.  Lastly, I removed Ibsen.  Ibsen's role in western culture is relatively minor and not nearly as great as the multi-volume novel Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese literature.  This novel has brought about the Chinese scholarly discipline called Redology.  I placed it under the novels, next to 1001 Nights.

I'll keep working later.  But the point is that figures who are relatively minor in the West and not well-known globally should be displaced by non-western figures; the West is so overrepresented, and the rest of the world has plenty of figures of huge importance, particularly in the pre-modern era.  The West was not dominant then, so there is no reason to privilege Western figures from that time."

It will remain that way; the vast majority of figures will be European or American.  I'm just adding the most egregious exclusions.  And it's not a matter always of simply ""fitting them in"" because many of those excluded are more significant than any number of those who were included.  Here's a clear example that I forgot.  Al-Ghazali is Islam's most significant medieval theologian, and his role in Islam is certainly greater than St. Francis, Mother Theresa or Giordano Bruno in Christianity.  So really, any of these could be eliminated.

I have added my removals to the page where those are listed.  Below I'll list a few more removals with rationales.

Al-Ghazali for Giordano Bruno 
Ibn Khaldun replaces Avicenna on the ""thinker"" list 
Avicennna is moved to the scientist list and replaces Pascal (Avicenna wrote the standard medical work lasting for hundreds of years, as well as numerous other fields) 
Ibn Battuta replaces von Humboldt among explorers (Ibn Battuta was a greater traveler than Marco Polo, in the same era.) 
Chanakya replaces Emile Durkheim (thinkers).  (Chanakya was the prime minister of the first Maurya king, who established the first pan-Indian empire.  Chanakya then wrote India's most important works of political philosophy.  He has been compared to Macchiavelli. The only Indian thinker on the list, despite India's incredible influence in China and esp Southeast Asia...) 
Suleiman the Magnificent replaces Mussolini.  Suleiman expanded a giant, extremely powerful empire and gave it its laws, and the Ottoman Empire dominated the Mediterranean for centuries.  Mussolini was the incompetent ruler of a weak country for about two decades.  There are already so many WWII era leaders, and Mussolini did not even make a big impact in WWII. 
Ashoka replaces Hirohito.  Hirohito was more a witness to history than a leader in it.  Ashoka was in large part responsible for the rise of Buddhism to the status of a world religion, as well as determining the political history of India.  He ruled probably the largest Indian empire. 
Harun al-Rashid is added to the leaders list, and Emma Goldman is removed from the activists.  As much as I love Emma, she's a relatively minor American anarchist.  Harun al-Rashid was the most powerful Islamic caliph, ruling an empire from the Atlantic to western China.  He was even made a central figure in the Arabian Nights, so he's possibly more famous even in the west, let alone the Islamic world. 
Hokusai replaces I. M. Pei, who seems to be the ""multicultural"" choice of the list.  Pei's article is short even in English, whereas Hokosai attracts more attention and made a much bigger impact, in both Japan and the West. 
Sinan replaces Donatello.  Donatello was an early Renaissance sculptor with a limited impact.  Sinan is the most famous Muslim architect, and his buildings still stand throughout the former Ottoman empire.  The article says: ""He was, during a period of fifty years, responsible for the construction or the supervision of every major building in the Ottoman Empire"" at the height of its power.

OK, that's all for now.  Total, those are only a few out of 1000."

There is a tendency that should be avoided here.  It is common in the western (Anglophone) imagination to hype the importance of the ""bad"" or ridiculous leaders of other countries.  Most people probably think that Mussolini is more significant than Garibaldi, who created Italy as a country.  Cixi is on this list, but not Sun Yat Sen.  Hirohito was there, but not Meiji, even though Hirohito's Japan generally followed the new imperialist path established by Meiji's Japan (neither had much power anyway).  Part of this is natural since Hirohito and Mussolini were the heads of state in wars against the US and UK.  But there's also a tendency to focus on leaders who are the butts of jokes and fascinating in their barbarity (e.g., the venality of Cixi).

This is a long lead up to one point (for now).  I'm replacing Cixi with Sun Yat Sen.  Yale prof. Jonathan Spence's standard work on China - The Search for Modern China - lists Cixi in its index only 6 times, but Sun Yat Sen is listed perhaps 50 times.  She just isn't that important."

Tale of Genji in place of Jose Saramago.  The latter is a popular writer who recently won the Nobel Prize, but even in the West he is not as well known as the Tale of Genji.  This is the world's first classic novel, and there is a quote in the Wiki article saying ""The Tale of Genji in particular is the highest pinnacle of Japanese literature. Even down to our day there has not been a piece of fiction to compare with it.""
Gupta Empire in place of the Thirty Years' War.  The Thirty Years' War is a direct political consequence of the Protestant Reformation, which is already listed.  The Gupta Empire is considered, according to its Wikipedia article, ""alongside with the Han Dynasty, Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization. The time of the Gupta Empire is referred to by some scholars as the Golden Age of India"". 
Han Dynasty in place of Mother Theresa.  This was the first durable Chinese state, and it is just as significant as the Roman Empire.  It was roughly as large, roughly as rich, and roughly contemporaneous with the Roman Empire.  Without it, China might never have become China. 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt in place of Queen Victoria.  Like Hirohito, Victoria was more a witness to history than a participant.  The history that she witnessed already has an entry here, under the British Empire.  FDR on the other hand won WWII (along with Stalin) and created the New Deal, which profoundly influenced the nature of capitalism.  The New Deal is now more influential than ever, and even under Reagan or Bush, it was never really reversed."

Well, maybe not the war itself, but what came of it: it ended the age where religion was a cause for war between Europeans, signaled the end of Spain as a world power, the negotiations at the end of it was the birth of modern diplomatics, and it created a system of thinking that would live on at least until the Congress of Vienna, or even until WWI. It's one of the largest singular events in European history. I think it's more worthy for inclusion than the relatively unimportant Spanish civil war.

The Thirty Years War is in fact the crisis of the Holy Roman Empire, so perhaps that is sufficient.  I am not sure yet.

Chinese Philosophy for Sun Tzu.  Chinese Philosophy generally is more important than one thinker.
Islamic Philosophy for Herodotus.  
Indian Philosophy is added, Hippocrates is moved to scientists, where Tycho Brahe was removed.
Ali under religious figures instead of Florence Nightingale (under activists).
Abbasid Caliphate instead of ""Viking"".  The Vikings were a few poor explorers and warriors on the margins of the world... The Abbasids led an empire for centuries (750-950), and when they lost their military power, they remained as something like Islamic popes (but definitely not exactly) until 1258.
Umar the Great instead of Harun al-Rashid.  Having added the Abbasids, I felt I could omit the greatest Abbasid (Harun).  Umar led the first Islamic conquests of Egypt, Persia, Syria and Palestine, so he is a world-historical conqueror.  He also helped determine what character Islamic rule would take.
I may still want to add Galen, who is probably the most important ancient physician (and a philosopher), in place of one of the other Greeks on the scientist list (eg Pythagoras or Hippocrates). --"

Well, they all overlap Electromagnetic radiation, and from a physics point of view, they are not that interesting. My reasoning for wanting to include Condensed matter is that it is the largest field in terms of research today, and Particle physics is a high-profile field that I think many people have some interest in. I do think both fields deserves a bit more attention, but I'm not sure what else could be included -- perhaps standard model and superconductivity or semiconductors?  
I do agree that Magnetic field could go, especially as we also have electromagnetism on the list."

The more I look at the list, the more I despair - there's so many overlapping and not very important articles on there - but replacing them seems impossible as it would make mean that well-known concepts would be treated in more general articles (speed and acceleration are good examples; I'd like to replace them both by :en:kinematics, but I know that would only be confusing). I think the current 10 articles on electromagnetics/light is way to much, there are good technical applications of stuff from other fields as well - there's even more inmportant part of the spectra from a technical POV. Sterilisation by UV pales when compared to the radio. And then there's stuff like nuclear fission or laser (also electromagnetics, but it doesn't overlap so much with the spectrum-specific articles) or particle accelerator. 
To sum up: replace Gamma ray, Infrared, Ultraviolet, as well as the too general Alloy. Replace them with semiconductor, nuclear fission, particle accelerator and something else (not sure if we should change the balance between physics and biology). The list will be more diverse, and hopefully still contain articles people will want to read."

In food, cereals, meat, vegetables, honey, fruits... are ok. But :en:chocolate? Really?

In beverage, there are :en:beer and :en:wine. Wouldn't it be better replacing them with :en:alcoholic beverages?

Under arts there is the :en:Cannes Festival. Is this a joke? Vandalism? or is there any explanation about this?

About using the word :en:film for cinema, I think it can be misleading. I know in en: they call film the article about cinema, but the interwikis are all mixed up, some link to articles about cinema, and some to articles about films.

For thousands of years of literature we have 31 authors, playwrights and poets. For a little more than one hundred years of Cinema we have 10 film directors and screenwriters. Isn't it too many?

No African native languages (what about :en:Swahili or any other :en:Bantu language? or maybe :en:Haussa, or :en:Mandinga, or :en:Amharic...). And of course no Native American language. Also, is :en:Esperanto worth being here? And if there's :en:Latin, do we need also :en:Spanish and :en:French? If there's :en:Sanskrit, do we need :en:Hindi and :en:Bengali? And two Germanic languages?

From the 40 history articles, not even one related to South America (what about Incas) and just one (apartheid) from black Africa (Zimbabwe? Ghana? Songhai? Mali? Swahili people?...)

Do we really need 48 articles about countries and 44 about cities?

While I was/am on a crusade to make this article less Eurocentric, I find many of these suggestions bizarre.  Should there only be one article relating to Christianity?  This is a religion followed by almost 2 billion people.  It's not a unified singular phenomenon, but rather a complex tradition.  If anything, Christianity is fine and MORE articles on Islam should be added, e.g., Sunnism/Shiism/Sufism.  And your example of an African leader to add is understandable, but probably not a good one.  I certainly agree that the pre-modern Malian leaders would be the best pre-modern Africans to add - but look at how little attention this leader has attracted even in English.  However, SOMETHING about Malian history could be added.  Perhaps the en:Mali Empire article could be added to the medieval section of history?  That's a very nice article right now.
Are you seriously suggesting that the Spanish and French articles be removed?  Spanish and French are the official languages of more countries than any language but English.  That is really crazy.  Likewise, Hindi is quite distinct from Sanskrit.  Both are of immeasurable importance.  Swahili may be an African language - and perhaps it should/could be included - but it is the native language of 5 to 10 million people.  Hindi is the native language of hundreds of millions.  It would be the height of absurdity to remove it.  --"

Or rather, I did, but they were reverted because they were too controversial after the discussion, I think we have more of a consensus on how this section should be changed.  No one has disputed that the article is too Eurocentric, the only question is which articles should be put in.  So, I'll propose some changes again.

 Louis Armstrong replaces Hendrix.  Louis Armstrong was the pioneer of jazz, the first global American genre, whereas Hendrix came as one of multiple 60's rock stars.  Hendrix is a very popular black musician among white Americans, but that is neither here nor there.  Armstrong changed history, and there are already some rock musicians on the list. 
 Musical instruments replaces Schumann, Robert. Having an article on musical instruments is allows for less Eurocentrism, because you can talk about various instruments from various times and places. 
 Edith Piaf for Hector Berlioz.  This section is so heavy on 19th century musicians and it needs some more 20th century musicians, especially non-Anglophones.  Edith Piaf was more famous in her day than Berlioz in his anyway.  She is maybe the best known non-Anglophone singer of the 20th century and is a national hero in France.

Now, I don't know where to go from here.  I will let Elvis stand because he is just too well known.  I don't think people liked my suggestions like en:Vladimir Vysotsky or Indian Music -  which attempted to make the section less Eurocentric.  I could add en:Vedas, en:Torah, en:Bible and en:Quran to replace these the four music articles listed below, or I could add some non-Western music articles.  Personally, I would like to do the latter.  There is already so much on this list about religion, but little about non-western pop culture.  My suggestions would be en:Vladimir Vysotsky, en:Umm Kulthum, and then Tango and Salsa under ""Dance"" (or maybe Latin American Music and Music of India).  In any case, let me know what you think about the music section (and the possible addition of a section on religious texts).

Brahms, Johannes 
Rolling Stones, The 
Smetana, Bedřich 
Bruckner, Anton 

Some more changes that were mentioned above, but which I now want to act on: 
 en:Galen for en:Hippocrates.  I can say categorically that Galen was the most influential medical scientist/doctor of antiquity, not Hippocrates. 
 en:Cai Lun for Fibonacci. If you want to fit in Fibonacci or Fibonacci numbers somewhere, try it.  The ancient inventor of paper is more significant than the medieval transmitter of some mathematical concepts to Europe.  If Fibonacci is just that important, perhaps Pythagorus should be removed (because ""some have questioned the scope of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy,"" as the wiki article says). 
 en:Tang Dynasty replaces Haile Selassie. There were already two other 20th century African nationalists on the list, so I thought that Selassie is probably redundant. The Tang Dynasty was probably the height of Chinese power, and it has an excellent article. I remember fondly reading this history when I was in school. Selassie has Rastafarianism, but that is rather odd. --"

Well, I would like to finish my edits to this list sometime soon (assuming that happens... and maybe I could help on the translations.)  So, I will go ahead with some of these.  Here's what I did:
 en:Galen replaces en:Hippocrates.
 en:Cai Lun replaces en:Pythagorus.  I thought it would be most fair to exchange an ancient for an ancient.  Pythagorus is more mythical than anything else, and even the Pythagorean theorem pre-dated him.
 en:Tang Dynasty replaces Haile Selassie.
Here is the music part.  Since people objected to my non-Western musicians, I decided the replace the excess classical composers with two non-Western musicians and two music genres that are somewhat more diverse.
 Louis Armstrong replaces Hendrix.
 Edith Piaf replaces Hector Berlioz.
 en:Flamenco replaces Schumann, Robert.
 en:Samba replaces Rolling Stones, The.
 en:Umm Kulthum replaces Smetana, Bedřich.  As the German Wikipedia article states, her status in the Arab world is similar to the Beatles in the Western world.
 en:Vladimir Vysotsky replaces Bruckner, Anton.

I suppose Vysotsky and Umm Kulthum may still not be consensus choices, since Arab and Soviet cultures are not exactly well-known in the West.  But as a measure of their importance, the articles of both state that at least 1 million people attended their funerals.  These outpourings could be compared to the death of John Lennon.  Let me know if you have an objection, but I am going to enter this into the list so that I can move on.  --"

For example, I think en:Spirituality should be removed in favor in specific forms of spirituality.  This is a good example of an overview article which isn't very interesting.  The English version has some basic, New Agey information and that's it.  In contrast, en:Sufism and en:Yoga have great articles that are already in more Wikipedias than en:Spirituality.  To make room, I would remove en:Indian philosophy.  Yoga is actually the most famous spiritual form of Indian philosophy and while I like overview articles as a way of including non-western cultures, the Indian philosophy article hadn't really attracted much attention, unfortunately.

I also want to remove en:Ali, who I added to the list of religious figures, in favor of en:Shia Islam as a subset of Islam.  Ali is the central figure in Shia Islam, so his story is a part of that broader story. For various reasons that I could go into, it's not necessary to include en:Sunni Islam (That is the majority denomination, so Sunnism has few practices that are distinct from Islam generally, in contrast to Shiism).  --"

That is still a problem, but he is the founder of Neo-Confucianism which dominated Asia for centuries as a de facto state religion (His article says: ""From 1313 to 1905, Zhu Xi's commentaries on the Four Books formed the basis of civil service examinations in China"").

For example, I imagine that every Wikipedia should have something about Obama, Bush, and the conflict in Israel/Palestine.  Why not have a section for ""Current Events and Recent History""?

So, my proposal is to take out 10 cities and 10 countries, and add a new section at the end called ""Current Events and Recent History"" or something like that.  As the section on countries already says, the countries listed are just some basics, and ultimately all countries should be included.  In addition, obviously, only the most world-historical events and leaders of recent years and decades could be added to this new section.  Here are some ideas:
 Obama
 George W. Bush
 Bill Clinton
 Ronald Reagan
 Thatcher

 Gorbachev
 Putin
 en:Deng Xiaoping
 en:Lula  (or en:Hugo Chavez)

OK, sure.  Such a list would certainly complicate things.  I only added it for its obvious usefulness.  All Wikipedias will want an article on Obama, Gorbachev, and September 11 for example.  This is not Eurocentric... it's just a fact of world politics.  Bush was more powerful than any Chinese emperor or any European king ever, in terms of world dominance.  He certainly isn't popular.  You could call him the conqueror of Iraq and Afghanistan, and he had troops stationed all over the world as well as political control over countries where no troops were.  Regardless of what ""the future"" thinks, any Wikipedia here and now will want this info in the here and now because it does matter.

She's also more famous than Shitao.  The Shitao article even in English isn't very good yet, let alone other languages.  Chinese painting is extraordinarily significant, but is there another painter who is better known?  We should be able to be both non-Eurocentric and to be able to choose 100% world-renowned figures.
 Sure, Hafez is good, but I really think en:Rumi is a better choice.  Rumi is more famous and his followers founded the Mevlevi Sufi order.
 The problem with Laozi is that he probably never existed.  But yeah, he is the most famous Taoist...
 Why remove Shiva?  I had en:Chanakya under the thinkers and he was brought to the economists.  I will undo this.  He is not primarily an economist (The wiki article just implies this awkwardly).  While I don't want to remove Shiva, Adi Shankara does seem significant.
 Sure, Sima Qian is significant, but I wanted one Chinese inventor on the list and Cai Lun is certainly famous.  Will there by no Chinese scientists?  China dominated scientific advancement up to c. 1500...
 Simone de Beauvoir simply cannot be removed.  She is the key feminist thinker, and feminism is profoundly affecting our lives  (Remember, this list is also necessarily biased toward the present rather than the past; not every century is going to get equal time).  Zhu Xi is still significant and there should be more than one Chinese thinker.  But why not remove another?  My suggestion: Let's remove the en:morality article.  It's partially redundant bc of en:ethics.  Morality is different in that it deals with modes of behavior, but morality as such is uninteresting (as the article shows; it's a short article with little info).  People are really interested in specific forms of morality, e.g., sexual morality, etc.
 I definitely support this one.  Either Cyrus or Darius are both far more significant than Cleopatra, who did not do anything.  She is just famous as a symbol of women's sexual power.  This is not a very feminist symbol, either.  There are already multiple Romans on the list, but no Persians.
 Kangxi is probably more significant than Rosa Luxemburg.  However, she was the leader of the German Revolution of 1918 and a major Marxist thinker.  And she's a woman.  Would it be at all possible to find another to remove?

I agree partially. Biography section needs to be more balanced.
 East Asian painters are not well-known to the Western world generally. So I can't find someone better than Shitao.
 It is not easy to compare Hafez with Rumi, but I would like to add Hafez. He is described as a ""poet's poet"".
 We cannot talk about Chinese philosophy without Laozi.
 Shiva is not a real person, and there is no Hindu philosopher on the list.
 The problem with Cai Lun is that historical record is not enough to support.

Hm, let's wait just a bit longer on Shitao.  His relative lack of fame is still problematic to me.  One strategy I like to use on this list is not always to add non-western people, but sometimes non-western ideas or concepts.  The west is more individualistic than others, so I feel like even the idea of long lists of ""great men"" is slightly eurocentric.  For example, I think it was a good idea to add Zen before Zhu Xi, because Zen was a whole philosophical school and a collaborative effort (Still want Zhu Xi though).  Likewise, Shiva has been a locus of Hindu religion that is more important than any one Hindu thinker.  However, I still think Ada Shankara is an good addition, just not as good as Shiva.  And Nehru cannot be removed, since he is the founder of the Republic of India, soon to be the world's most populous country.

I relent on the point about Cai Lun.  His biography is just too spare.  I removed him and added Sima Qian (under Historians).  I also removed morality and added Zhu Xi.

For example, of nearly 3 million English Wikipedia article there is no article on ""Painting in Mexico"" whatsoever, or even ""Mexican Art"".  For me personally, en:German literature generally is more important than en:Goethe.  And yet, the actually existing overview of German literature is nothing but a list of links to articles on a few styles and numerous individual writers. The article on Goethe is quite good - even though few Americans have heard of him (the majority of English Wikipedia contributors).  It's also been translated into roughly 3x the number of languages. In helping shape this list, my goal has been to respond partly to what has already been written, rather than re-writing Wikipedia from scratch.  To some extent, the articles that are written reflect the needs of the readers.
It should surely be said also that the point of an encyclopedia is to inform.  So it's quite right that there are some figures on the list that you may not have heard of.  If you don't know much about Islamic history, you won't have heard of en:Umar.  What overview would he fit under... well, most likely en:Rashidun, which even fewer people have heard of, and its article is shorter than and inferior to the article on Umar.
Since these overview articles are so unpopular and poorly written, the biographies are the only alternative.  Many famous topics, like feminism, are certainly already on the list. I think the practice of this list relates closely also to how Wikipedia is used. I personally as a college student and now a graduate student use biographical articles all the time to get background on various subjects.

Two kinds of awkwardness arise from this fact.
    (1) Some of the experts aren't experts, and the resulting list is necessarily a bunglesome farrago (albeit one that's improving over time, as additional minds contribute). The survival of Smetana for so long among the set of European composers attests to that, as do the members of the present set: J. S. Bach, The Beatles, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Dvořák, Handel, Mahler, Mozart, Puccini, Schubert, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Vivaldi, Vysotsky, Wagner. The inclusion of a few of these is laughable. (Vysotsky? Really?) Many are problematic—the preference for Chopin, for example, over Schumann: Schumann composed equally compelling piano works, but has the additional notability of having composed important songs & symphonies & an opera, and having founded an influential musical journal, which he edited and in which he published reviews and articles of aesthetic criticism. If one had to choose the seventeen (and why that number?) European composers whose musical achievements were the most influential or representative of their times, a poll of the most influential professional music historians would almost certainly agree on most of these eleven, listed in chronological order: Perotinus, Machaut, Dufay, Iosquin des Prez, Palestrina, Monteverdi, J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Wagner, Schoenberg, Stravinsky. Yet seven of them don't make the current cut! If one had the freedom to include their most notable contemporaries or near-contemporaries, one could add Leoninus to Perotinus, Handel to Bach, Mozart to Beethoven, and Verdi to Wagner. But why bother? It might be better to reduce the list to ten (striking Wagner), and thereby making room for influential musicians from the rest of the world. § Note that by starting the chronology in the thirteenth century, we've ignored a few highly influential musicians, like en:Guido of Arezzo, but their effects could be accommodated in more general articles, one of which, en:Gregorian chant, or, even more generally, an article (to be written?) on the (historically related?) cantillation of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, might well want to be among the favored thousand.
     (2) The project of the thousand important pages is a top-down enterprise: people at the top (the experts) dictate what people farther down (the less learned) should know. In this, it's no less old-fashioned than dead-tree encyclopedias. Is it possible to construct a bottom-up list? Can the current state of wikitechnology find the thousand most-searched-for pages? Those would be the topics that the world really wants to know about. To the extent that the whole wiki enterprise is involved in marketing (making available to the public a product that the public wants), that would seem to be a reasonable way to go, as soon as technology permits it. —JWL, 71.178.66.126 19:11, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

Some very good ideas here. Your second point is a great one, but I don't know how to go about bringing that into practice. If you could bring such a list into existence on a totally different basis, then our discussions here would not be too relevant anyway.

When I get time, I'll toss you (below) some non-Western musical topics that are far, far, far more important than some of the European composers in the current list. 71.191.115.153 14:05, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

I say, far better to exclude the medieval than to exclude the non-Western.  I have been actively editing these lists, and I did remove Schumann among others and added Vysotsky, en:Umm Kalthoum, Edith Piaf, etc.  It's valuable to question that (no one did when I brought it up on the discussion page), but on principle the list cannot be purely Western classical composers, whose time has in any case long passed.  Vysotsky and Umm Kalthoum's cultural positions in Eastern Europe and the Arab world respectively are roughly similar to that of the Beatles in America and the UK, particularly in the case of Umm Kalthoum, and they both have political significance, unlike most classical composers.  The list when I found it was full of 19th century German(ic) composers who may matter to the world's classical music aficianados, but they aren't the whole story of world music.  Perhaps using a better tack, I added some more diverse genres, like en:hip hop, en:samba and en:flamenco.  But back to the biographies, 19th century Europeans are still in the majority. 
If anything, these lists should be biased against obscure medieval composers, no matter how significant, and biased in favor of important recent musicians.  Vivaldi is ""better"" or more innovative musically than en:the Beatles, but which one is needed by readers more?  However, it should not be totally biased against non-Anglophone musicians, because these musicians aren't forgotten at all - they are in fact hugely famous and important, just not for Americans or Brits. 
The ideal would not be to have one expert on European classical music, but rather a few musicologists who could come together to combine contemporary popular music, non-Western musical forms and Western classical music into one good list.  We don't have that, so we make do, insofar as we believe that there should be a list like this. 
As for some of the specific composers, Dufay, Perotin and Josquin des Prez certainly have not been written about very much in non-English wikipedias, so it would be quite awkward to add them.  I'd guess that only a tiny handful of people has ever heard of them in any country.  Perotin's article is only about 6 paragraphs long even in English, for example.  Monteverdi has been written about, though, so he should perhaps be added.  I'll let you respond to my comments first before discussing more. --"

An obvious criterion (obvious at least to one conversant with the history of music) is historical influence, and its prime question would be ""Which composers have most affected the history of music?"" And augmenting that: ""Which composers best represent an era of profound historical influence?"" Given those questions (but once again only in regard to European music, and leaving aside the question of non-Western music), the inclusion of Brahms, Chopin, Dvořák, Mahler, Puccini, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Vivaldi, and especially Vysotsky, to the exclusion of Perotinus, Machaut, Dufay, Iosquin des Prez, Palestrina, Monteverdi, and Schoenberg doesn't make sense.
But of course there are other ways of making sense, and ""modern popularity"" could be one of them. That brings us back to the bottom-up process. ""What do people want to know?"" is utterly different from ""What should people know?"" That's why it might be useful to discover which topics people are actually searching for.
On this point, thanks to a hint from MarsRover (above), see the new threads I've started below. JWL, 71.191.115.153 14:47, 25 April 2009 (UTC)
A third angle—in regard now to the whole list, not just the European composers—could be to study the linking that already exists within the English wikipedia, which has enough substantial articles that patterns among the links could serve as a criterion for finding the thousand most important articles. Presumably, for example, since Beethoven was historically a more influential & exemplary composer than, say, his near-contemporary Hummel, a huge encyclopedia will have more articles that have links to :en:Beethoven than to :en:Johann Nepomuk Hummel. You can probably see where this idea leads: find the thousand most-linked-to articles, and those will necessarily be the conceptual hubs around which the most sought constellations of topics revolve.
Side note, back to music: there's no good reason to include Vivaldi but to exclude (for example) Telemann, a similarly productive (but not especially innovative or influential) composer; or to include Chopin but to exclude Domenico Scarlatti, a similarly productive keyboard composer. And Mozart is often my favorite composer, but to include him, once you've admitted you must have Beethoven, is a waste of a valuable slot—and this example opens up another set of choices: if you're going to include Mozart even though you've already got Beethoven, you can't exclude Schuetz just because you've already got Monteverdi. Which you haven't yet got, of course. :) JWL, 71.191.115.153 14:05, 25 April 2009 (UTC)
Ultimately, the criteria for inclusion have to be a compromise between what people want to know and what they should know.  In fact, my normal method has been to choose only those figures or concepts that are both important and in high demand.  There is really no other way of going about this.  I'm a PhD student in Islamic history, and even though I consider en:Muhammad Ali of Egypt to have had far more important effects than the conqueror en:Saladin (especially on today's world), popularity has caused me to allow the latter to stand.  For example, Celine Dion is nearly as popular as Mozart, and both are worlds more popular than Perotinus, yet which one of those three would make sense on this list?  Your exclusion of Mozart is a very obvious sign that something is wrong with your criteria.--"

Mozart has been very influential and is very important, and he is in very great demand on Wikipedia.  Perotinus was important, but is not in demand.  Adding him to the list would be something like re-writing Wikipedia, since his existing articles are so pitiful and need to be re-written.  Adding Celine Dion is in demand, but is not important.  This list cannot be filled with Celine Dions or Perotinuses.  Simply put, you include Mozart because of his modern popularity and his huge role in modern culture.--"

Throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, Beethoven was the artist who loomed large—indeed, probably largest of all, The Most Important Composer Of All Time (tm). Brahms wasn't popularly called a second Mozart, after all; nor was his first symphony hailed as Mozart's forty-second (as it was Beethoven's tenth); nor did the three B's (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms) include Mozart. In Paine Hall at Harvard, the names of the most famous/influential composers parade from the back left around the wall to the back right, and guess whose name was contrived to stand in the middle, directly above center stage: Beethoven. In Symphony Hall, Boston, the name of one, and only one, composer stands above the stage: Beethoven. The best way of accommodating Mozart—and Haydn! and a host of others!—might be to abandon the biographies altogether (as suggested at the top) and cite the article on :en:Classical period (music). JWL, 71.191.115.153 17:02, 25 April 2009 (UTC)
The same cannot be said for even Schuetz and Monteverdi.
As for some of your lists below, I think they could well be useful, but what you have so far isn't very useful.  Those lists don't yet tell us much about what musicians/composers should be listed.  The only other thing that I would add is that popularity is not always reflected by what has been written.  My point here has been to make this less Eurocentric, and Wikipedia has some built in Eurocentric biases.  People from developed countries have better Internet access and so are more likely to write articles, even though people from poor countries still use Wikipedia  (The Spanish Wikipedia has the second highest number of ""contributors"" and yet far more articles have been written in German and French).  So, beyond popularity and importance in the West, I would add that importance in other cultures is the third criterium, to counteract the inherent bias of Wikipedia.
Regarding Vysotsky, the disagreement here turns on the fact that I do not consider Vysotsky to be a ""Western"" musician.  He is certainly not popular in the ""West"" (ie, Western Europe and North America) or even well-known.  He is popular in the former Soviet Union, which we in the West have been utterly cut off from and implacably hostile to (esp in the US).
If you are familiar with non-Western musics, let's consider replacing him with another non-Western musician, perhaps from a culture that has been more neglected on the list than Soviet culture.  I just had a hard time doing that.  One seemingly easy choice would be en:Fela Kuti, who is one of my favorite musicians and as big in West Africa as Vysotsky in the USSR and the Beatles in the US/UK.  However, he's not particularly in demand on Wikipedia, it seems (eg, translations).  The same goes for the Pakistani musician en:Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.  Ravi Shankar could be a possibility, but his Western popularity makes me more skeptical: is he a Western phenomenon or was he really hugely popular in India?  I don't know enough about India so I can't say, though I would be very open to an Indian musician.  In any case, Vysotsky is more in demand on Wikipedia than any of these musicians.  So, even if a musician is important, let's make sure we choose ones that have an established presence on Wikipedia.
As for Vivaldi or Chopin, they and others can be on the chopping block if you like (I certainly didn't add them).  You definitely know more about classical music than others here, so go ahead.  It will help to check the popularity of various composers though.  I usually look at the list of translations on the side of the articles to compare.  If you want to use a more ""scientific"" method, go ahead.  The real question, though, is how to include non-Western musics.  I mean, this list is just a starting point, so if it has Vivaldi and not Telemann, it's not a big deal.  A failure to include non-Western musics generally, though, would be a bigger problem.  --"

For European music (again if the biographies, or most of them, were cut), add :en:Gregorian chant—maybe the most popular European genre of all time, if popularity is regarded as extending across more than a millennium—and :en:Chamber music and :en:Concerto.

Well, I did have the thought of adding a number of those articles, and I even briefly added ""Music of India"" and ""Music of Africa"" (This wasn't a popular idea, though).  But as you can already see, none of these articles are yet truly important parts of Wikipedia.  All of this constitutes basically re-writing Wikipedia and going strongly against what people want and use.  Yes, people should know about en:Carnatic music, but I'm not sure that they are that interested; Ravi Shankar would probably be a better choice.  I also like this sort of scholarly approach to things, but I've been told time and time again that this ""goes against the natural growth"" of Wikipedia.  The idea of strict chronological importance, whereby only one composer is listed from a single period is very unpopular and overly strict.  If we were to be strict like this and ignore fame, then Western music would be dramatically reduced to only about 1/5 of the articles on this list generally, which would be fair but unrealistic.  The reality is that certain things are more famous and in demand than others.  The idea of leaving out Mozart is just silly and out of touch with Wikipedia and its users.  --"

Gregorian chant is one of many forms of Western music already on the list, and it's the least popular, if oldest etc.  However, surely some of these should be added....  Everything that you're saying is musically and historically correct, just not always appropriate.  We can't re-write Wikipedia from here, especially not in all its languages.
As for the philosophy though, remember the purpose of the list: to aid smaller (non-English) wikipedias in getting a base of articles.  Myself, I tend to imagine one medium sized Wikipedia (Arabic) and one new, small Wikipedia (en:Egyptian Arabic).  For readers of both of these wikipedias, having an article about Mozart will be much more important than having an article about Noh or Gamelan.  The problem with these genres is that they are important in the eyes of western scholars, rather than average Westerners or average non-Westerners.  For example, even in Japan, J-Pop or en:Enka might be more popular and more accessed than en:Noh.  Even for the average Chinese reader, the article on Mozart will be more useful than the article on Beijing opera.  So this is what I keep in mind. --"

Ramon Llull (s.XIII) is considered a multifacetic wise and relevant writer, philosopher, mystic, theologian, missionary and also gived very influence as a scientist: mathematics, physics, technologics, etc.. He writted 265 books in Latin, Catalan (wrote the first major work of Catalan language literature), Occitan and Arabic. He is representative of the mediterranean middle ages.
Jorge Luis Borges is an important writter in the 20th century, but Wikipedia shouldn't give more importance to the recent literature than old literature.

 Population
 Capitals were chosen over larger cities if that country already had a representing country.
 Historically important cities
 Social popularity

Chosen:

 Kinshasa - capital of Democratic Republic of the Congo. 248,728 hits in 2008.
 Lagos - largest city in Nigeria. 441,671 hits in 2008.

Not chosen:

 No Canadian cities
 Ottawa - capital of Canada. 690,528 hits in 2008.
 Toronto - largest city in Canada. 1,582,973 hits in 2008.
 Ho Chi Minh City - largest city and capital of Vietnam. 423,639 hits in 2008.

These were just a few I looked at. On a worldwide scope the chosen were more populous but I would say notably historically on an international level they lack significance over other cities. For example Ho Chi Minh City is a major economic center for Asia East and became politically important for Communism in China and the West during the Vietnam War and Cold War. Lagos and Kinshasa are really just big cities with much smaller world affect. Are populated cities really cities that every encyclopedia should have, or maybe things such as a cities importance to history and its global role be more closely prioritized. If not, then the same logic could be applied to other categories citing that because more people saw Wedding Crashers it should replace Citizen Kane (a film ranked for 50 years at the top of director and critic lists in film). 207.6.241.10 03:11, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
I agree with removing these two. But I think it would be a better idea not to replace them with other cities, but to leave the space to expand other sections: History, Mathematics or even Biographies. I think that a full list of countries and specially, cities, is pretty much useless if they have no real worldwide influence, and even if they have, it seems much more useful an article about, for example, the :en:Cuban Missile Crisis or the :en:Cuban Revolution than a general article which speaks about the climate in :en:Cuba. We should not take the present configuration as unmodifiable, I think that the next step is precisely to rearrange the sections. --"

2. Helen Keller made the list as a political leader, but Thomas Jefferson did not? Are you kidding? He can also be included under Scientists.

4. Propose to add Cleopatra as a political leader. She was a very powerful leader in Ancient Egypt and her influence is felt throughout the world even today.

5. Propose to keep Political Leaders and remove Aristocrats. Aristocrats should have something to contribute politically to be included on this list or be moved. 

6. When choosing people to be on the list, I think it's important to ask, ""Did this person change the world?"" In that context, Sun Tsu is much more influential as a strategist and a mathematician than some celebrities of modern day. 

7. Under Religious Figures and Theologians, I propose to add Mary to the list, since a number of religions follow her to this day including Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Anglican Church, Islam, and certain Protestant denominations."

Propose merging the following categories into one under the title of Visual and Performing Artists: Actors, dancers and models, Artists and architects, Authors, playwrights and poets, Composers and musicians, Film directors and screenwriters. There are 83 people in this list combined, which makes it a very long list compared to other categories. Does the category of Visual and Performing Art deserve that much attention compared to other disciplines? It may, but it's something worth discussing.

 One person saying that Cleopatra ""didn't do anything"" is not exactly a discussion. When you mention the name Cleopatra, no one says, ""Which one?"" She was the head of state, in charge of the military and a royal dynasty. She continues to be included in history books of just about every language 2,000 years after her death. Any person who can not compete with that record can be replaced including: Sarah Bernhardt, Marlene Dietrich, George Byron, Vladimir Nabokov, Vladimir Vysotsky, Helen Keller, Saint Paul (not a founder of a religion, if anything, he can be replace by Mary), Augustine of Hippo (also not a founder of a religion.

If anyone is able to do this, please report your findings. Is the rest of the world laughing at us for not knowing what Raw Materials are? Before we go around telling everyone else what they need to know, let's make sure we know what we're talking about, shall we?

My suggestion to rename the page has to do with international diplomacy and cultural awareness and not political correctness. There are many multilingual administrators on Wikipedia who will be very happy to get involved if they are invited to participate and become aware of this project. The dangers of dictating what the rest of the world ""should"" be doing is evident in the global financial crisis that is currently underway and is a direct result of the rest of the world adopting ""the best financial system in the world that can not possibly fail"" (ours). We do not need to be writing instructions for the rest of the world to follow and doing it in English behind closed doors.

I think that phrases such as ""may not reflect broad consensus"", ""is intended as a guideline"" and ""should not be viewed as dictating how important certain topics are, but only as a utility for smaller Wikipedias to start from"" state clearly enough that this list doesn't intend to dictate topics.
By what reasoning you proclaim making of this list ""behind closed doors"" is beyond me. Almost every local list (as far as I checked) has a link back to this page, so saying that there are ""many"" people who would get involved if we weren't so secretive is completely groundless.
People that speak English well enough to translate this list into their language, also speak it well enough to understand the introduction and make suggestions for changes.
If you bothered to read through some of the older discussions, you'd see that non-English editors contributed their suggestions, some of which were implemented if there was consensus. Myself and mine included. By what other standards you would know what ""generally accepted facts"" are is also beyond me. 
So, if you have suggestions to improve the coverage of world-wide topics, please propose changes. If I understand correctly, you propose to add :en:Raw material to the list. Interesting, but the term is generally viewed as too broad, which is probably why the article about it only exists in 20 other languages, and we have articles about many raw materials on the list. --"

I respect the fact that a lot of time has been invested in this page. You are correct when you say that I do not understand the difference between English Wikipedia and a Meta-Wiki. Is this explained somewhere? At the same time, I question the categories that have been selected and the lists that follow because they do not reflect generally accepted facts and principles of existing classification systems (in any language). Were they based on something? For example: under the existing category Raw Materials, the items listed are not raw materials. Under the category Health and Medicine, the list that follows does not reflect how classifications are made in the medical field. Under Weather, climate and geology, Geology is a science, which is not related in any way to weather and climate. Why is Architecture and civil engineering listed under Arts and recreation? Why are Foodstuffs and Beverages listed under Science? What classification system is being used here?

I understand now what you feel is wrong with this list. To be honest, it probably doesn't follow any formal classification scheme, because many people add and delete entries, and reorganize how they feel is right. I very much agree that the current scheme has many problems but I'm afraid nobody here knows enough about these things to propose a useful general classification.

Sure, obviously had confused ""Grapefruit"" with ""Grape"", which are important for the production of wine.

It is a bit confusing to discuss unrelated topics such as forms of sexuality, fruit and sports the same time. 
For an estimation of the status of the entries of the list's current ""social issues"" section, one could look at the table of contents of the Standord Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, which has about 2,000 entries. Among them are: abortion, punishment and legal punishment, race, human rights. But there is also an article on homosexuality. Of course this should not be the only source for this wikimedia list.

 :en:sex has links to articles in Scandinavian languages like :sv:Kön, :no:Kjønn, :da:Køn etc. which mean biological sex or gender. On the other hand the same article links to German :de:Sex which is rather the sexual practice. It seems to me that in languages of latin origin (incl English in this case) these two concepts are described with the same word and so are naturally described in one article. I think it would be a good idea to clear out more precisely which concept is meant to be included in this list, and then try to sort out iw-links. I find it difficult to sort things out myself as English is not my mother tongue, so I can't really tell the exact differences of all the concepts like :en:Sex, :en:Sexual intercourse, :en:Biological sex, :en:Sexual reproduction etc.
 :en:Law had a similar confusion regarding iw-links, as some languages seem to understand rather the field of science, other a particular rule. It seems that this might have been cleared up and etymological related Scandinavian words like :sv:Lag, :da:Lov (jura), :nn:Lov are now linked with German :de:Gesetz, :la:Lex (incl its derivations in modern romance languages) and many other languages not including English. There is anyway a tendency that people add :en:Law to this circle of articles, introducing an iw-conflict. Maybe this is a concept that should exist also in the English wp?

These are just two examples, but I think there are also other unclear concepts on this list.

And they're right.  No offense, but it seems that any podunk European artist or intellectual can make the list (another note...HEAVY HEAVY bias towards intellectuals), whereas all but the greatest Americans (Washington, FDR, Edison, MLK Jr.) make the cut.  And to my nominations 

In the politicians category:

Dwight Eisenhower
Reasoning--it's basically like this...if DeGaulle's in, Eisenhower should be too.  He cleaned up the mess that men like DeGaulle couldn't, then served as President of a nation more powerful and populous than France.
Abraham Lincoln
I don't quite see the logic in picking Washington and FDR as America's two best political leaders, even though they did more on the world stage.  Lincoln is viewed as a symbol of American freedom in many distant lands.  Plus, most historical rankings of American figures put Abe above GW
Obama
Reverse logic here.  Just add him to the list because he already has a Wikipedia article in over 150 languages, dozens more than Washington

In one of the intellectual categories
Ben Franklin
Thomas Jefferson in bold.
The philosophers and intellectuals lists are heavy on dead Europeans, while being light on dead Americans.  I know both of these men were politicians too, but they were also two of the main founders of American political thought, as witnessed by the volumes Thomas Jefferson wrote on anything and everything  

CUT TO OFFSET:
Chomsky.  
Make no mistake about it.  I think Noam's a great thinker.  But I don't think that he's worthy of being one of the 20-30 greatest social scientists in the history of the world, nor do I think he's one of the couple hundred people most worthy of a Wikipedia article in 100+ languages 
Speilberg
You could get me to agree with you that Steven is one of the greatest movie directors in America.  In a longshot, you might get me to agree that makes a list of the 2-3000 articles every Wiki needs.  You CANNOT get me to agree that Steven deserves to be on this list more than Ben Franklin or Abraham Lincoln

1. adding 5 political figures, and removing none. Without explanation why political figures are more important than other people.
2. adding 5 Americans when a lot of people come to this discussion complaining it is too Western.
3. adding Obama merely because he is popular when the list is about importance (popular != importance)
4. removing Speilberg when he's the last big movie director remaining (just removed George Lucus)

Since you chose to poke holes, I'll poke holes in your holes by restating some of my points above, and adding new ones.  For starters, I nominated Franklin and Jefferson as philosophers, which they were, rather than political figures.  America is NOT well represented by philosophers, except for Noam Chomskey (yes, he's American).  I feel that there are not enough world leaders on the list, and, as a political determinist, I feel that political events impact history (which biography basically is), and I feel that Abraham Lincoln had a bigger impact on both American and world history than most of the Americans on the list (with the exception of GW and Edison) and many of the political leaders on the list.  Would you argue that Spielberg is more important, in or out of America, than Lincoln (especially considering that historians have yet to weigh in on Speilberg, and Hitch and Disney are still on the list)?  And add Helen Keller to the boot list, at least out of the political section, to make space for Lincoln.  I admit that the cases for Obama and Eisenhower are weak, but you've at least gotta admit that Lincoln, Jefferson, and Franklin deserve inclusion.  Oh, and one more thing...I have not proposed cutting ANY non-Westerners, just replacing some (worse) Westerners with some better ones. Purplebackpack89 03:11, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

So in a nutshell, here's my argument:
Politicians
Add Abraham Lincoln, delete Helen Keller (first of all, she's not a politician; second of all, although she has a compelling life story, she didn't change the course of American or World History like Lincoln did)

Philosophers
Add Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin and delete two Western thinkers, as there are no true American philosophers on the list. 

Inventors
Add Wright Bros, nix Euler...the airplane I believe to be more important to most cultures than a higher-level calculus equation Purplebackpack89 17:13, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

Few interesting things...Lincoln makes the list in the English vital list, the Latin one and the Spanish list, yet Keller doesn't make any of those (even the one in her own culture)...and the French one has several current heads of state (as does, interestingly, the Wright Bros...also, while we're at it, let's bold John Locke and Beijing.

Emm... you do know that Euler was a pioneer in many areas of mathematics, probably one of the three most important mathematicians? There are certainly those on the list with a far less impressing resume to exclude before him. Also, it seems that rather than including the Wright brothers, what should really be added is :en:fixed-wing aircraft. 
I do agree that Lincoln would probably fit on the list. "

Please enlighten.  My main point is that the list favor higher-level mathematicians over people who invented widely-known things, such as the Wright Bros and the airplane.  Would you agree in my assessment, and perhaps suggest a better mathematician to toss?  In the section devoted to transportation, aircraft does indeed appear, as all would agree it should.

For a presentation of Euler, I think it would be better if you'd read his article: he's made contributions to so many fields in mathematics that it would be too much to present here.

These people just yankies knows, like only Brazilians knows Getulio Vargas, these people can have a importance in U.S.A. but not worldwide importance. And just to complete, just yankies thinks that Wright brothers are the inventors of the airplane, in Brazil is Santos Dumont. And for me this list is very yankiecentrist list, have articles of ice hockey and baseball, that are sports almost only played in the U.S.A. and don't have Formula 1 or Rugby that are worldwide followed, and just to finish, the list don't have Pele and Maradona, the two most famous football players in the world and famous in every country, and they are not in the list...let me see why...maybe because they are not yankies I think is that. --

As stated before, perfectly fine with tossing ice hockey in favor of rugby; not fine with tossing a sport also played in China, Japan, the Netherlands and the Caribbean.  And I would note that there aren't ANY sports stars from anywhere on the list, though I acknowledge that if sports stars should be added (which they shouldn't), Pele would be near the top of my list.  So I guess that's one vote AGAINST inclusion of Franklin and Jefferson (I retracted nomination of Ike). BTW, as I recall, Vargas was president of Brazil in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, and came up with something called import-substitution industrialization

Such as adding a biography and removing a language. There are two reasons (1) it is hard to compare the importance of two completely different topics (2) it will distort the proportion of articles in each topic and we will eventually have 1000 biographies. So if we are adding ""Lincoln"" which historical figure should be removed?

That said, I tend to lean toward adding articles about events or machines than people. For example ""American Civil War"" instead of ""Abraham Lincoln"". ""Aircraft"" instead of ""Wright Bros"". Also when figuring out importance, you have think historical importance, too. ""Damascus"", the city, has been around since 10000 BC. --MarsRover 20:52, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

 Just for you to know, Damascus is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Not important?

Earlier, you weren't okay with booting Speilberg for Lincoln, but would you be OK with booting Helen Keller (because she's not a politician and Abraham Lincoln did way more to impact American/World History)?  And to Santista, I somewhat agree that it's counterproductive to try and change the whole system, and instead we should focus on little improvement (i.e. getting Lincoln or Jefferson or Rugby or Columbia on the list).  That being said, I do think that there is a bias on this list to computer science and related fields."

If there aren't any important enough composer or musician from the rest of the world, then probably this section is over sized, and most of the entries can be removed and the places in the list be used for something else.

In other languages the most common word is the corresponding to velocity (romanic languages) with the same meaning, the translaton of speed is a word similar to celerity that is a very technical word only used in phisics. Furthermore, the article is classified into Science/ Phisics. Then the article deserving to belong to the list of 1000 articles every wikipedia should have is velocity rather than speed. --

The concept of velocity is a compound, of which I think only the speed element is key, and it is a compound that most languages do not have, so stating that all wikipediae should have an article about it is pointless: they can't.
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2009	49	 Speed/velocity 	8	Gomà	18:06, 22 August 2009 (UTC)	Thinking of the velocity as a compound because of its Cartesian (or any other coordinate system) components is like thinking of a point as a compound because of its Cartesian components. Velocity is a singular concept, even if it is a vector. Speed is a concept derived from velocity that cannot be explained without the aid of velocity. Wikipedia is about concepts, not words. If a language doesn’t have a single word to express a concept then can use a sentence. --

A 'point in space' may have them attached, although many other types of coordinates could also serve. Speed is not derived from velocity and can easily be explained without it; in fact, the directional component of velocity is the part that cannot be explained in any way without the concept of speed.
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2009	49	 Speed/velocity 	10	Gomà	11:12, 23 August 2009 (UTC)	" Paraphrasing your sentence: A 'vector' does not have Cartesian components. A 'vector' may have them attached, although many other types of coordinates could also serve. Speed in physics is derived from velocity and is explained as the modulus of velocity; in fact, the change in spatial position makes no sense without the directional component of velocity and speed only can be explained without the aid of the concept of velocity by reducing space dimensions to 1 (linear movement) and hiding its vector nature.
 Instead of discussing about the fundamentals of the physical concepts I suggest you reading the articles as they are now. As they are, the situation is this: Speed article don't say anything else than: Speed is the modulus of velocity. If you can improve the article speed with external references in the way you point to then perhaps I could agree. Otherwise as the articles are just now I think you should agree with me.--"

Anyway I wouldn't disagree with the suggested change, or replacing Turkish, or just leaving it the same. --MarsRover 21:49, 20 October 2009 (UTC)
 I think the list is not to mention all the largest things, but a hint to write the first interesting content of a new Wikipedia edition. If so, Esperanto is good on the list, since one can write in the article something less banal than number of speakers and countries where it's official. 
 If it depended on my will, I would cut down from the 1000 list as much „template articles“ as I could. Adding (often with a bot, or even by hand but without much thinking)  articles with a large template full of numbers is the weird way how many smaller editions now start. While we know very well that those editions look at this list, we might influence those new Wikipedias with a good advice on writing Wikipedia."

This genus doesn't have much characteristics to distinguish it from the family :en:Suidae, so if somebody will try to expand it in order to get it over 30.000 characters, it will invariably mean duplicating content from the Suidae article and probably also from :en:Domestic pig as the english article does now. That's why I suggest replacing the :en:Pig entry with either :en:Suidae (as a more relevant grouping), en:Domestic pig (as the one pig species important enough to be here), or some other animal group alltogether (because we already have a lot of domestic animals in the list). Comments/suggestions? --

I think ""Domestic Pig""  makes sense since the animal is important for being domesticated. And it's match ""Domestic Sheep"" which is also in the list. --MarsRover 17:48, 17 September 2009 (UTC)
Like I said, :en:Pig is larger because it contains information that belongs to either :en:Suidae or :en:Domestic pig article. Suidae, on the other hand, has a lot of potential for growth because it's a very distinct and well researched group of mammals. :en:Domestic pig is an option as well, if you feel that the abundance of domestic animals on the list is not a problem. --"

I didn't explicitly object, I just said that Suidae would be (IMO) a more suitable replacement. But I have nothing againts domestic pigs per se (plus, they're tasty :P). Out of those listed, camel would probably be the least problematic to remove.

Their basic goal is indeed to be a general reference suitable for general audience - meaning average readers (even if articles may also contain specialized information or be about specialized topics). This applies even more to the list of 1000 basic topics we are creating here. Specialized projects, such as :Wikispecies, are separate from Wikipedia. As for your other argument, this list is by no means exclusive to meta users. I, for example, am primarily a (Slovene) Wikipedia editor, and speak from that experience when suggesting or commenting changes to the list. So does probably everybody else. Most Wikipedias have a translated local version of the list (see links at the top of the page), with the link back here. It's true that many people probably don't know about it, but anyone that comes across the link can come here and voice his/her opinion. --

Not a single article that says anything significant about nordic history, culture or geography (Except the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, none of which seems to be really all that important from a non-Eurocentric point of view). Also the baltic states seem to be forgotten. Are the nordic countries really so much less important than the rest of Europe?

Finland has played a great part in keeping Russia the Soviet Union away from the rest of Europe throughout the 20th century, without this being mentioned much in the history books (or on wikipedia).
Finland has a remarkable geography, with all its lakes.
The vikings were influential in most of Europe for a few hundred years. Not any less historically important than the article about the Hundred Years' War, the American Civil War, the reformation, the Great Depression, the German nazis or Holocaust (there is already one on WWII). Norse language also had a great influence on the English language.
Norway has a remarkable coastline with all its fjords, none of which are mentioned on this list. The long ""bodies of water""-section needs at least two or three fjords.
Norway is today an economically and politically powerful state, despite being one of the smallest nations in Europe. It is also ranked by the UN to be the worlds best country to live in. Scandinavian citizens are considered to have a higher standard of living than most of the world, including Northern America and the rest of Europe.
Norse mythology is as rich as any other kind of religion, and is, together with details from the norse language, even today used and explored by various people, for example musicians and writers.

In the ""countries"" sections, there are listed several European countries similar to the nordic countries in size and importance: Greece, Austria, Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, New Zealand... But none of the nordic or baltic countries. It seems to be a random collection of countries.

A couple of proposals:
Remove Ireland, Austria, Netherlands and Switzerland. They share most of their history with other european countries that are already listed, and are therefore even less important articles than the nordic countries. Put Finland and some of the Scandinavian and /or baltic states into the countries section.
Remove some of the less remarkable /important bodies of water, like the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, Niger River, North Sea, Danube (only important in an all-European world), Rhine (not even top 100 of worlds longest rivers!). Put in the worlds two biggest fjords. (The Scoresby Sund and the Sognefjord).
Put in Greenland, the world's biggest island.
Remove Nazi Germany to get room for the vikings. We already have WWII on the list, as well as Germany.
That will be all for now. ;-) --"

Middle East is just a list of countries. The en.wp managed to make it into a decently sized article by explaining how the term came about (which has an English/American origin),  duplicating/summarizing information and using it as an outline article. Maybe there are so many events we need a summary article about the area but it doesn't fit this list's goal of having articles about specific topics. --MarsRover 20:45, 11 November 2009 (UTC)

To discuss how snow and rain are formed, much of the same has to be repeated since rain are often formed as snow melts on the way down from the clouds. All of this would fit better by discussing ""precipitation"" in general. Precipitation is also what is interesting in the water cycle. Snow has another problem, since it can refer to snowfall, snow cover or snow as material. Yet another precipitation related article is ""acid rain"". I suggest that precipitation should replace rain and snow as articles every Wikipedia should have. Doing this would make it possible to add ""wind"", which is a very basic meteorological subject. --"

Under 'Mountains, valleys and deserts', add en:Gobi desert. Remove New Zealand.
Under 'Mountains, valleys and deserts', add en:Great Plains. Remove Cuba.
Under 'Mountains, valleys and deserts', add en:Amazon Rainforest. Remove Vietnam.
Under 'Mountains, valleys and deserts', add en:Serengeti. Remove Thailand.
I realize that a rainforest is not a mountain, valley or desert, but I think it fits here. Perhaps the Great Barrier Reef should be moved here (as its not a body of water), but the sub-category should probably be renamed. How about 'Other specific geographical concepts'? (I know, that's terrible!) And I don't mean any offense to the four countries, but I do feel that the countries list is over-long. 67.102.22.242 21:40, 16 December 2009 (UTC)

Last one. Add en:Aurora (astronomy) under Mountains, valleys and deserts and delete either Mexico or Mexico City. 67.102.22.242 22:00, 16 December 2009 (UTC)

I don't agree with the premise replacing countries with specific geographic areas is a good idea. Countries are core topics that cover many dimensions like history, geography and politics. For example we already have ""Tanzania"" which should talk a little about the ""Serengeti"". We have ""Brazil"" and ""Amazon River"" so ""Amazon Rainforest"" is sort of covered. The other suggestions just don't seem to be important enough. --MarsRover 02:02, 18 December 2009 (UTC)

However, as the current one is not an official version, some Wikipedias (e.g. Chinese Wikipedia) still have to use Version 1.1 as refernces, so it is difficult to improve the score in List of Wikipedias by sample of articles (which uses the latest version).

The problem is to add new names. The idea is to have only 1000 articles, and we have reduced the author list to about 50.

That seems to be what we actually do right now, the articles in en:wp are about common-law system, mainly about regulations in USA and GB.

In some languages the consept of deity is just going to be called god anyway, because not all languages have one Germanic and one Latinate word for basically the same thing. Here's how the repsective English articles start defining god and diety:
 :en:God: ""God most commonly refers to the deity worshiped by followers of monotheistic and monolatrist religions, whom they believe to be the creator and overseer of the universe."" – but of course the word can also be used of the dieties of polytheistic religions (e.g. the gods of Greek and Roman mythology).
 :en:Deity: ""A deity is a postulated preternatural or supernatural being, who is always of significant power, worshipped, thought holy, divine, or sacred, held in high regard, or respected by human beings."" – The article then goes on to describe the concept of God.
I suggest dropping :en:Deity --140.180.2.62 19:56, 4 March 2008 (UTC)
Actually Deity is bold (as in being more important of the two) but it would be a hard sell removing ""God"". -MarsRover 01:30, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
Well, but then the question arises: should it be bold? Maybe god should be bold and deity removed? There's no need to have two articles that basically discuss the same thing on the list. In fact there's no need to have two articles in the English Wikipedia at all, one ought to be a redirect to the other. But in any case you are a deity iff you are a god. And therefore not all languages will have words to distinguish artificially between the two so as to be able to write two articles. Think of it this way: What if the list were in German and users agreed that it was important to have to have three major cognitive abilities wissen, kennen, and können. Well, English wouldn't be able to have all the articles on the list because there's only one word for all the German words, viz. ""to know"". Now in this case it's worse, because unlike knowing that, knowing how and simply knowing where there's actually a distinction to be made, there's no real distinction to be made between a deity and a god — if x is a god, then x is a deity; and if x is a deity, then x is a god. The English Wikipedia shouldn't even have two articles just because it has two words, let alone require all other languages to coin words so as to be able to make the same artificial distinction. So having both words on the list makes it linguistically biased. --140.180.20.42 03:56, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
There is a difference between 'God' and 'god'. I think you are correct 'god' == 'deity' but 'God' is more specific than 'deity' since it is the specific deity for Christianity, Judaism and even Islam (since I believe 'God' == 'Allah'). But I get your point of heavy overlap between the two topics. Its similar to the overlap between en:Respiratory system and en:Lung. Also, one of the complaints about this list is its too ""Western oriented"" so my gut feeling is we need both of them. --MarsRover 18:04, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
But this article is not confined to the :en:God in Abrahamic religions. It also mentions Hinduism and even Buddhism. If you want to argue that there ought to be an article about the God that is common to Christianity, Judaism and Islam, then :en:God in Abrahamic religions ought to be it. I still think that the English articles God and Deity should simply be merged. If you disagree with that, then presumably you are of the opinion that God ought to be merged with :en:God in Abrahamic religions. Or am I mistaken? --140.180.20.42 19:21, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
Didn't realise the en:God article was made so generic. There is still a difference between the two topics where 'God' is a subset of 'deity'. ('God' is the singular deity for monotheistic religion where as 'deity' includes plural god religions). My guess is when other people create their initial 'God' article it will match the more specific 'God in Christianity and Judaism' sense (not the over analyzed 'God in the generic sense'). So, you're right there is a lot of overlap if you assume other wikis are going to copy en.wp way of organizationing itself. But I hope they don't. --MarsRover 20:45, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
But they have to if they want to complete the list. That's what I am saying. Because there IS no distinction between god and deity, although it CAN BE MADE artificially since English has two words. But in some other languages the article for god is going to contain both the discussion for god and deity because not all languages have two words for the same thing, one of a Germanic root and the other derived from Latin. And those languages will therefore always miss one of the two articles. Unless they have an article about god in Abrahamic religions and then another about god/deity (which would then be really be about god/deity in general). But the iw-links will then only link to one of the two articles on the list anyway (because the former would link to :en:God in Abrahamic religions and the latter to either one of the other two, :en:God or :en:Deity). Besides the idea that the word god refers to a monotheistic conception of a deity is simply incorrect. Zeus is a god (in fact his very name is a cognate of the word deity, both deriving from the same Indo-European root). Apollo is also a god. So is Neptune and Odin. The gods of polytheistic religions are also called gods. It is only a spelling convention in Christian countries which dictates that when referring to the Christian god (sic) the word should be spelled with a capital letter. --140.180.20.42 21:19, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
:en:Divinity is another article that ought to be merged with :en:God and :en:Deity. --140.180.20.42 06:51, 9 March 2008 (UTC)
Thankfully that one isn't in this list. There is a fine difference between these articles (just try merging them and see how far you get). I also noticed someone wants to splinter the :en:God in Abrahamic religions into more articles, uugh. The question is which articles ""should"" every wikipedia have. Considering the significant overlap and the limit of 1000 articles I agree we should remove 'deity'. But I am looked forward to someone else commenting. --MarsRover 18:14, 9 March 2008 (UTC)
To Christians, and I expect followers of some other religions, there is a big difference between God, the God, and any old deity.  If Deity is meant as a synonym for God, clearly there is no need for a separate article.--"

The usual way to put this list to use in a small wp is to translate it locally and then start creating articles for the hundreds of red links that result from the translation. There is no particular logic as to why this list should be 1000 articles long, rather than, say 500 or 1500 articles, other than sheer practicality. If it is too long, a small wp project (with say four very active contributors) will feel discouraged by the work involved in translating it.

Maybe your proposed equilibrium could be an additional step in the future to work towards.

That being said, I could see us trimming down some of the grains which seem to be over-emphasized: (I say, keep Maize and Rice in Ceareals, and ditch the rest of the cereals.) Therefore, I propose we make Foodstuffs -5 instead of -7.

I would prefer to lower the number trimmed out of biography from -100 to -35. It's painful enough removing stuff; I can't imagine picking 100 to remove! I'd rather keep History, Math, and Tech closer to where they are right now, rather than make such big and painful swings to the Biographical group.

To keep Sappho, a poet of whose work very little survives, for the reason that she was a woman, as one of 2 representatives of arguably the most influential literature of human history, seems absurd. Are we applying retroactive affirmative action on writers?

Also, regarding Roman authors, I can see why one would leave Ovid out and Vergil and Horace are obvious choices from Latin poetry, but there's no prose author represented; no Cicero, Sallust, Livy, Seneca, Tacitus.

The title: ""List of articles every Wikipedia should have"" sounds very bad.

As clearly written in the intro, it's not the rule, but an advice what a general encyclopedia should have.

Country is just silly – even the English article is short and in many languages the word is fairly synonymous with state, which is much more important and which we already have. (For example, the exact Finnish translation is ""maa"" which means land, country, soil, Earth (Maa) and is appropriately a disambiguation page). Pronunciation should definitely also be removed, it's more suitable for Wiktionary than Wikipedia and is bound to remain stubby in all languages. Not sure about the others – at least male and female seem fairly fundamental concepts. I also think that we should rename city > town as the latter seems to be a more generic word and the English article has about 90 interwikis as opposed to the 24 in city. Having city is just English-centric as clearly the preferred concept in a vast majority of Wikipedia languages is town. I also support removing deity, per above as it overlaps with god in many languages, and the article has few interwikis. For example, the Finnish article on god begins: ""Jumala, jumaluus tai jumalolento on käsite, joka..."" (""God, deity or [another synonym] is a concept, which...""). --"

Belgium is culturally sort of a mix between the Netherlands and France, and no mather how great Irish culture is I think that from a non-English-speaking majority view it should be removed. What we should add is Nigeria, instead of Tanzania, a huge African country. IMHO it's practically a crime not to have it. There are some problems with the cities as well. I think we should rather have Delhi than New Delhi – of course New Delhi is the actual capital, but it's pretty much a part of Delhi itself and Delhi is a much bigger city.

I removed Belgium and added Nigeria: I believe this is justified, because we already have France and the Netherlands and because Nigeria is a huge country, one of the most important in Africa. This also counters the Eurocentric bias.
I removed country, because it's superfluous to state in many languages, short even in the English Wikipedia and has very few interwikis, so clearly it is hard to translate or not considered important in many languages.
I removed deity, it's very much superfluous to god in many languages, and several people have talked about this before. It also has relatively few interwikis. I bolded god because of this.
I also removed male and female. We already have sex, ad apparently also woman and man, discussing these concepts from a human point of view.
I changed city into town, because this is the preferred concept in a vast majority of languages.
I'm not sure if I was too quick, feel free to discuss here or revert if necessary :) I think that one of the problems with this list is that it's not as universal as it should be – the English language should only be used as a means to an end, not the starting point.

In English, city is obviously the more important concept. There are a few languages that make the same difference: Japanese has :ja:都市, Arabic has :ar:مدينة (but it links back to town!), Latin has :la:urbs, Icelandic has :is:borg and of Chinese I'm not sure. Slovene :sl:mesto, Spanish :es:ciudad and Azeri :az:Şəhər interwikis should probably be moved from city to town. Italian, Portuguese and Russian have the same interwiki in both articles. French makes the distinction between :fr:ville and :fr:cité, but the latter has a different meaning and ville seems to be the preferred concept. The rest seem to be pretty much in town. Of course, a possible solution would also be to move most of the interwikis into city. --

Great. Most of the actors, dancers and models listed in the article are unfamiliar to non-Western peoples (I, for example, did not know that the people mentioned above , except Marilyn Monroe, have some degree of importance until I read WP:VA. And we can remove entries about most recreation biographies in the article then add entries about history, social sciences to counter systemic bias in many language editions of Wikipedia (Though I know this problem several years ago, it's very surprising to me that social phenomenon and violent crime has only two interwiki links, but William ""Bill"" Kim, a secondary character in Prison Break has 6 interwiki links!), since adding important entries which has only a few links to the list pushes many Wikipedias to focus on really important entries.

The following are the entries I consider important as most entries in the present list (which I once added to the list but later get reverted): 

 Leopold von Ranke
 Historiography
 Interwar period
 Finland (for the now reputable education, see Education in Finland, which is an important article but only has 4 interwikis.)

Include :en:Lagos, :en:Kinshasa (both with at least over 7 million residents) :en:Kolkata (urban area of 15 million) :en:Bogotá (over 7 million) and :en:Dhaka (capital of one of the biggest countries in the world). This also counters the Eurocentric bias.
Remove :en:Dublin, :en:Edinburgh, :en:Naples, :en:Tel Aviv and :en:Melbourne and/or :en:Canberra. I can't really think of a reason for including these: with Dublin we might as well have Helsinki, Copenhagen and Stockholm, Edinburgh really isn't important, we already have Jerusalem from Israel (which is culturally more important) and two cities from Australia is definitely enough if we are only going to have three from China (!!). Italy is great, but three cities is just too much.

I am creating a 10,000-list on English Wikipedia, but the problem is reversed: it is hard to find the 10,000 best topics (Do you know the world's top 300 scientists?).  However, overall, it is amazing how much better & easier a large list works: just add the ""top 100"" of everything, adding 500 per week for 18 weeks. The extent of real information is awesome. -209.214.44.173 07:15, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
 After reading through the discussion page here, cutting it back to 1000 seems psychotic.  Why not bump it, eventually, to a slightly higher - or less arbitrary - number?  170.201.180.137 18:52, 25 September 2008 (UTC)
Remember that this list is primarily meant to be a guide for small Wikipedias for what they should focus on to be useful as a reference. Covering 1000 topics from scratch isn't easy, covering more is more difficult still if you have only a couple of regular contributors. Nobody is required to follow this list. By the way, is there any number that isn't arbitrary? No matter how many you'd include, there would always be somebody arguing that there is another super-necessary topic to add. So the answer to the question ""why 1000?"" is simply - ""why not?"". --"

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2008	55	1000 is just too few	0	Yerpo	07:52, 24 October 2008 (UTC)	"24-Oct-2008: After studying the list for years, I finally realized that 1,000 articles is absolutely too small, and perhaps 5,000 would have been much better.  A Wikipedia doesn't need all 5,000 articles immediately, but it would be a long-term goal.  Why did 1,000 fail to cover the range? Because using only 1000 was like trying to represent a ""football field"" in ""3 inches of soil"". It might seem (at first) that grass is still grass in 3 inches, but only one yardline or goal-line could fit within 3 inches, and putting a goal post in there pushes a yardline marker out. Plus, those yardline numbers for 20, 30, 40, 50 won't fit inside a 3-inch plug of grass, and it can't show the ""whole 9 yards"" before the next first down.  In this analogy, a football field could be better represented in a 10-yard segment (10% of the whole 100-yard field), showing 2 yardlines 10 feet apart, with the goal line, and a chain measuring the 9 yards until the next first down.  Likewise, for an encyclopedia, consider listing 10% of a large collection, such as 10% of 50,000 articles = 5,000 articles.

Because the English Wikipedia is so huge (2.6 million articles), I'm creating a list of 10,000 highly notable topics: those are the articles that should be improved above ""good-article"" level, because they are the core of a full encyclopedia.  Among those 10,000 articles, will be:
 about 250 famous athletes among the top Olympic/sports figures;
 over 150 TV/film actors that represent long-term impact;
 over 100 major artists of ballet/opera/etc.;
 some of the top 50 racehorses of the past 200 years;
 many breeds of cat/dog/horse that appear in formal shows;
 dozens of food items (intended to span many food cultures);
 famous authors, journalists, and mystics around the world.
Each Wikipedia can reach an international audience, and for that reason, a large set of core articles should be written, long-term.

The problem has been a lack of scope to show people that the core list covers enough to track the overall progress of expanding the articles. In the past, there was no incentive to improve the 4 articles about actors, when more than 150 actors have had obvious impact in English films.  Now, with a larger list, multiple people can divide the work, each improving ""10 articles"" in the total list, with the understanding that those are the articles that people will be reading, not just the 4 actors in the 1000-list.  I, personally, don't care to push featured-article level, just improve those 10,000 articles to have sources & some significant details in each. If there are some awkward phrases or weak sections, that is close enough.  I feel that the featured-article requirement, to expand all weak sections, can be overkill, if the basic details are already present in an article.

Anyway, the most important point is that the 1000-list is absolutely too small (someone tried a 1300-article list, but it got trimmed back down).  Instead, list 5,000 or 10,000 major articles, and allow each Wikipedia to take years developing those articles as a long-term goal.  Each Wikipedia could decide how to prioritize articles that have lower impact for their readers, but don't try to cram 500 years of stage acting into 4 people, or 4500 years of scientific progress into 30 people, etc.  Quite honestly, the 1000-list approach is just plain ""goofy"" as a measure of information, or as someone above said, the effect ""seems psychotic"" because it's mentally unbalanced, like trying to cram the football field into 3 inches of soil (as a measure of ""how to construct a football field"").  More yards are needed, and more articles are needed to clarify what is involved in building the thing. -209.214.44.173 07:15, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

See my above reply. Any number we'd set would be completely subjective and not much less psychotic to conform to (especially when people decided to cram dozens of racehorses in). Remember, there's a difference between ""important"" and ""notable"", and what is hugely popular in the English-speaking world (or even USA alone) may be almost unknown in other parts of the world (such as baseball, rugby and racehorses), hence globally unimportant. Otherwise you have a point, but instead of trying to convert this list which everybody seems to want, why not just make another? Here, have a link. --"

Note now, Wikimedia can do calculations: code as """" (result: average notable articles omitted for each listed article: , rounded to 2 places). Remember, Wikimedia is a vast computing tool as well as repository.  The MediaWiki software can perform thousands of calcs per second, and there is no need to shorten the list if Wikimedia does the calcs.

Listing 2000 is easier: However, we could add 1,000 entries (as 2,000 total), to allow mentally dividing by 1,000 and halving, as division by 2000.  So, yes, 2000 articles would be easier to hand-calculate than 1009, and I vote YES to quickly expand the list to 2,000 for easy calculations. To pad as 2000 entries, insert the periodic table of atomic elements (or such) as filler, then delete elements from the end to keep the list as 2,000 when more entries are added. Certainly, every Wikipedia should have the (universal) atomic elements, but the end (radioactive) elements are not as notable, and easily deleted. I would also add hundreds of Nobel Prize winners, since that is a worldwide concern, and showcases world technologies and styles. Another form of quick filler could be a list of Olympic sporting events (which applies to the whole world), and then delete from that list as space is needed.  Wikimedia is recommending only the minimum, and anyone can list ALL the atomic elements (or Olympic events) in their encyclopedia, even those not in a 2000-article core list.  Beware that it won't take long to find 2000 world-wide important articles, so the next hand-calculation is 5000 articles: multiply by 2 and shift 4 places (.0000), to divide by 5000. -209.214.44.173 09:49, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

Articles have different importance. Something people have to accept for any size list to make sense. But once you accept that, its just a matter of sorting and truncating. But I believe we should leave it at 1000 articles. Its small enough to force people to filter the list by importance, large enough to be a starting point for balanced coverage, and yet a doable task for new wiki. -MarsRover 20:49, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

 I think that writing 1,000 articles is enough work for a new wiki. For example, in the Galician wikipedia, we have created more than 40,000 articles after five years; but there are still a few articles from the 1,000 list waiting to be written."

I see now that the list can be interpreted as articles that a Wikipedia language ""must have"" (rather than ""should have""), and the German Wikipedia had just 984 articles in their variation as the core list for German.  I have only recently viewed the Absent-Articles listing (which limits reporting to those Wikipedias which have omitted fewer than 250 from the total list): if the list were much longer, then absent-article counts could exceed the 250 (dropping those Wikipedias from the list), and there would be less information about which articles are slow to implement. Currently, I see that ""everyone"" has the very-famous people, such as Beethoven, Dvorak, Puccini, Verdi, Einstein, Elvis, Marilyn, The Beatles, Spielberg, Fellini, Kubrick, Walt Disney, Florence Nightingale, Dante Alighieri and en:Omar Khayyám, plus common terms such as Week, Month, Year, Kilometre, Foot, Kilogram, Litre, Polytheism, Football, Baseball, Rugby & Game. Obviously, many Wikipedias omit the less-known people (such as American en:Walt Whitman, en:Satyajit Ray, or en:Abu Nuwas) and expensive activities (like en:Horse racing or en:Auto racing). However, the least-favorite articles include the abstract/broad concepts, such as Reality, Thought, Writing, Prose, Fiction, Behavior, Beauty, Truth, Morality, Domestication & Measurement.  Perhaps keep the list around 1000-1200, but avoid abstract terms and unusual people, thereby allowing each Wikipedia to add their own notable people in their realm.

The term cetacea includes whales and dolphins. So, it overlaps with having Dolphin in the list. I would actually prefer having either :en:Blue Whale (""largest animal ever to have existed"") or :en:Sperm Whale (""largest living toothed animal"" and of :en:Moby Dick fame). The en.wp cetacea article mainly lists the various species of the order which doesn't seem to be an article every wikipedia should have. --MarsRover 05:43, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

Articles about cetacea are featured on four different language versions, so it's certainly possible to write good articles about the subject. Also, even en:Whale mostly deals with things that could just as well be in the article about the order (it even mentions dolphins as a type of whale). "

Indeed, the English concept of 'whale', does present its problems as it's not a biological term, while Swedish 'valar' (plural form of 'val') is both about biology and general concept (ref. the old Swedish biological term 'valdjur' is not used nowadays, making 'valar' a term with at least two definitions). Same problems arise in languages such as Catalan (where 'balena' primarily means a baleen whale) and probably in Arabic, both Wikipedias carrying an current ""Absent value"" of 1 to 2. So, making English language/the English language Wikipedia the model for all Wikipedias does have its ups and downs. Then, thanks once more, Yerpo.--"

:en:Niagara Falls (globally important? I don't think so, and we already have the Great Lakes on the list from that region)
:en:International Atomic Energy Agency (far less influential and therefore important as it should be, IMO)

Instead I propose that Agriculture be moved from the section on business and economics, to the section on technology. Although the business and economic side of agriculture is very important, fundamentally agriculture concerns the production of food and other products of the land. It is true that business and economics were largely built upon a foundation of agriculture. However, agriculture exists outside of business and economics, subsistence agriculture still being a way of life for some. Agriculture, though, depends completely on technology, to plant, harvest and store crops. So, could we place agriculture under technology, where irrigation stands now, and have irrigation and plough as subsections of agriculture?

Take a look at the artists and architects: they are all European/American! (OK, Frida Kahlo is Mexican)  So much to add to this list, and so much to remove!  Granted, this list will be Eurocentric to some degree; the world is eurocentric, it's the way most people think, and it's the information most people want, even those speaking obscure languages that do not yet have wikipedia....  However, it would be worthwhile to still include a large minority of non-Western figures.  Some examples...

Arts/Architecture: Sinan (Ottoman architect of Istanbul)
Writers:  This list is better, but I might add... Lu Xun (creator of modern Chinese prose), Firdowsi (10th c. national poet of Iran), others
Social Scientists: Muhammad Iqbal, Ibn Khaldun (14th c. muslim sociologist), Zhu Xi (theorist of yin/yang, state ideologist)
Political leaders:  How can politics be so Eurocentric!  And the few non-Western leaders are lame, only present because they're famous in the West (eg, Saladin).  Some better figures: Harun al-Rashid (caliph), Kangxi, Suleiman the Magnificent, Justinian, Taizong.
Activists:  Helen Keller and Emma Goldman?  I'm a fan of the latter, but she's only there because she's American- Helen Keller likewise.  Some better ones: Garibaldi, Saad Zaghlul (Egyptian nationalist), Hong Xuiqan (leader of the incredible Taiping rebellion)

Well, can't say you're not right, this list is a bit eurocentric. Unfortunately, most of us are westerners, so we are somewhat biased towards topics we know. Whom do you propose to remove (apart from the two activists)? Keep in mind that the biography section is considered too large and like you said, we should focus on information that most people will seek. I would support inclusion of Suleiman and the freshening up of activists section. Other than that, it's best that somebody else says something about it as well. --"

Yes I agree, the country list here is POV, Spain indeed, should be bolded, and so are Portugal Greece and Saudi Arabia, for their cultural contributions and spheres of influence. One criteria to consider is the country population size: Nigeria (8th) and the Philippines (12th) are worth listing here. Thailand and Dem. Rep of the Congo can be removed.

Also, it is a sheer waste of time to translate the articles line by line, esp about the entities of which a volunteer has not heard in his/her whole life, let alone the fact that there is always a risk of misinterpretation in such translations. Also, waiting for years to create a reasonable length of these articles can be a frustating experience. So, I was wondering if we could have a bot/ number of bots and a database cotaining basic information of these artilcles. This can increase the value of this page at the same time accelerate the creation of meaningful wikipediae and aid in dissmination of knowledge. Thank you. --

The latest cuts were solely intended to get the list down to 200 entries and were mostly arbitrary. A further revision of the list is absolutely needed. It still stands, however, that to keep this list at a practical 1000 entries an addition should be accompanied by an elimination. If you suggest keeping the biographies of these two authors, could you also indicate which entries to eliminate instead? We still need to eliminate over 100 entries to get the entire list down to 1000, but I guess that 200 biographies is reasonable (although initially they were supposed to be only 100). --

1: this is (I assume) a list of articles that we think ought to exist in every language version of Wikipedia
2: this is not a list of the “most important” articles
3: as all of the articles under consideration already exist in e.g. the English Wikipedia, we are quite specifically not concerned with that.

Now, if we want to make a list of the articles that we think most important, or that we think everyone ought to have read, then great; but that is not this list. I see two possible interpretations for the scope of this project:

1: articles that ought to exist in every Wikipedia
2: articles that ought to exist in every Wikipedia but might not otherwise (so no need to include articles that will naturally be written without guidance)

I favour the former, but accept a certain validity in the latter. However, that’s a long way from what I see this list to be. I’d like to encourage everyone to consider the needs of a minority language speaker, someone for whom their Wikipedia will be one of the only sources of online information. See my post above, “The Quechua Test” for suggestions. I’d contend that no article should be added to the list without consideration of the readership in this way.

Addendum: I feel that the list ought to contain a slight bias towards explanations of current events, as minority language speakers may have no access to anything approaching an informed and unbiased news source. 
Articles should also be included on issues where other information available may be prejudiced, e.g. women’s rights, medicine, other human rights, cases of minority languages attaining workable legal status, health risks common in less developed regions, justice, etc."

 Hmmm. Why is it not this list? I agree that in many ways the current list is somewhat arbitrary and will not likely ever be finished in any sense, but I contend that any list of this kind will necessarily be arbitrary. I don't think there is any surefire way of making an unbiased, universally useful list of 1000 articles that every language edition of Wikipedia should have. I think your point about taking the point of view of minority languages is very valid, as I believe the usefulness of this list lies mainly in how it can be a tool for helping along small wikipedia projects (and hence my stress on keeping it at only 1000 articles). It seems obvious to me that this list becomes useless once all of the entries on it have been created by a certain wikipedia, and hence, that it is hardly of any consequence for the larger wikipedias, such as the English one. I think you should maybe suggest what kind of changes you'd like to see done here. --"

As the Finnish national epos it is the flagship of one of the richest oral traditions in the world - the Finnic mythology. About hundred thousand folk poems have been collected from Finnic peoples to the folk poem archive of Finland. Kalevala, even while it haves only a small portion of those poems, represents all that. It is written in a unique European language and unique metre. In Kalevala there are layers of mythology from all time perioids since stone age. It is translated in many languages. There is nothing else about Finland in this list of articles even though Finland is one of the leading countries in welfare, health care, fight against corruption, education, womens rights, democracy, technological achievements, journalist freedom, economic competitiveness and so on (look statistics at the Finland article). There is nothing about any Fenno-Ugric people in this list even though most scientist agree that Fenno-Ugric languages were spoken at Northern Europe before Indo-European languages and so Fenno-Ugrics are native European languages and an important part of what Europeans are composed of just like Christianity or Hellenic culture.

Perhaps the list was compiled by contributors who learned their music from concerts & recordings (which of course reflect particular markets), or who may have been pushing certain parochial favorites; but whatever the cause, its historical perspective is skewed: it overweights recent centuries, and thereby doesn't comprehend the full range of the field. It's exclusively a list of Western (mostly European) composers & entertainers, none of them prominent more than 300 years ago. For a universal encyclopedia, the list has at least two basic problems: (1) it lacks personages from all the important traditions of the world; (2) it omits known composers who've proved exceedingly important in influencing the evolution of music (and it includes some who fall short of that criterion). In other words, it's unbalanced with regard to space (problem 1) and with regard to time (problem 2). I can't address the first problem at the moment, but let's work at solving the second.

First, remove the popular entertainers (Presley, Elvis, born 1935; Beatles, The, ca. 1941; Hendrix, Jimi, 1942; Rolling Stones, The, ca. 1943). Of these, the Beatles may have the best claim to be on this list, as perhaps composers at the tertiary level (see below), but these entries belong in another category altogether—one that might include :en:Louis Armstrong, :en:Francis Albert ""Frank"" Sinatra, :en:Édith Piaf, :en:Christy's Minstrels, and any of numerous other popular entertainers (like en:Fred Astaire and en:Ginger Rogers and en:Harry Houdini, :en:Charles Sherwood Stratton, and so on). Rename the category as Composers.

Now let's put the composers who've influenced the evolution of (Western) music in better historical perspective. Let's arbitrarily limit the list to twenty. I offer twenty such suggestions below, embedded in a much longer—but still exceedingly incomplete!—list, with the names of additional potentially important composers, all ranked in four classes: the ten‡ most important for the history of Western music (flushleft, in boldface), first-rank composers (flushleft), secondary composers (one tab to the right), and tertiary composers (two tabs to the right). I've put the names in birth-order. This ranking is highly tentative (I might tweak it from hour to hour!), and others will disagree in many particulars, but I'd expect a consensus on at least half of the twenty. If you sample a hundred well-qualified professors of music history, it's unlikely that they'll agree that, for example, as the current list implies, Bedřich Smetana was one of The Twenty Most Important Composers Of All Time. It may also be unlikely that such a sample of experts would move the other third-ranked composers into the boldfaced first rank and vice versa. The list omits composers under the age of 80 only because they're too close to our time, and sorting out the evolution of (Western) music after the Second World War may be premature; for a similar and even more conservative reason, nobody is boldfaced after Verdi & Wagner.

N.B. I've tried to be evenhanded here: I've put some of these composers at levels that don't correspond with the degrees of pleasure I get from their art: for example, I'm usually not all that fond of Debussy (to whom I might prefer Mahler), and though I like Bartók, he may be slipping into the second rank as history moves on; further, though Mozart is sometimes my favorite composer, he was probably not so historically influential as Beethoven, or perhaps even as some of those here ranked at the second level (e.g., Leoninus & Landini): doubts on all sides arise! If I had to demote one of the top twenty, it might have to be Ockeghem. If I had to promote one from the second to the first rank, it might have to be—if not Leoninus or Landini—Lully, mainly because he was so important in setting the style of French music at the court of Louis XIV (a style that lasted long after he died and had influence well beyond France). One could similarly quibble against or in favor of many of the other nonprimary names.

‡Ten? Better forty or fifty?! Anyone competent in the history of Western music should be able to say something pertinent about each name on the list above."

Anyway, I wanted to propose some movement in musicians and composers, because today this list is quite ridiculous. We have a not really notable person - Mr. Smetana (never heard of - have you, guys?) while we don't have neither Gershwin nor Mendelssohn-Bartholdy nor Palestrina! I don't even demand Polish Szymanowski or Lutosławski (pretty notable people), Estonian Pärt, world famous Schönberg or Cage... but that's some obvious POV Push and scandal. :)
What is more, personally I do believe contemporary music is important and should be present in bigger quota. Today, we lack on the list icons like Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Kurt Cobain, Metallica and many more, who gained popularity and influence all around the world. Is U2 really more popular or influencial?
All the positions on the today list (except already mentioned Mr. Smetana) seem to be valid - we just need to expand this list. :)

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2007	25	 Minor languages 	0	Mxn	19:09, 24 November 2007 (UTC)	"This list is about minority languages. All of these articles will appear on the English-language and Spanish-language wikipedias in time; as i understand it, the aim of this list is to put together 1000 articles that should appear in all those little wikipedias, that maybe don't even have 1000 articles yet.

Now, there are two classes of minority language speaker -- those who are also fluent in a majority language (say, Hawaiian-speakers or Welsh-speakers who also speak English) and those who are not, such as speakers of languages peculiar to small regions, often in the developing world. In the first case, the minor language Wikipedia is a project to keep the language alive, and that is a noble goal; but I suggest that it is those who have no other recourse to information to whom we owe the greatest consideration.

The people who speak minority languages are often looked down on as uneducated fools, and their rights are not respected by employers, landowners, government workers, etc. They have very little access to information, as even though they may be able to use the internet (cybercafes are ubiquitous in the andean highlands), there are very few pages that they are capable of understanding; an employer, knowing that a worker is unaware of her rights, is often not quick to inform her. In the regions where I have been active, literacy is not uncommon but any education beyond primary level is very rare. 

Having spent over 7 years working with people who speak minor Andean and Amazonian languages such as Quechua, Aymara and Yagua, there are certain questions that I am asked all the time, things that a very large number of people are interested in. These might include questions about the country they live in, the government and government systems, modern technology, agriculture (the occupation of the overwhelming majority), the law, childcare, and, most of all, health and medicine. ""What is this drug that I have been given?"" ""Should my kid be able to talk by his age?"" ""What is the internet and what can it do for me?"" ""What is the Free Trade Agreement, and will it mean that I can no longer sell my crops?""

In seven years, I can safely say that I have never been asked about Urdu, Fencing, or Ernst Haeckel.

This list is a beautiful thing. It might be, for instance, a list of articles that all Wikipedians should read, a kind of culturally universal education. However, it smacks of educational imperialism to say that these are the articles that must be available to minority language speakers. 

Of course, in a sense, any list compiled in English but for minority language speakers will suffer the same criticism. The ideal would be to go to those people and ask them what they would like to know. Had we a little funding, we could put together a proper survey.

However, without investing any money, I have put together a starter list here, based largely on personal experience and follow-on logic. I was considering deleting the entire current list and substituting in this one (be bold!). However, for the moment, I haven't: I don't mean disrespect to the many users who have joined forces to make a very valuable list, albeit one that is misnamed and misplaced. Later, I (or rather, we) should -- based on criteria of interest (are people actually going to access the article) and utility (will they learn something important from it).

The list that I'm putting forward might seem biased towards medicine. That's partially because it is important and of interest to the people we are working for, but also because of the way that the articles seemed to fit. An article on Human Rights ought to be long, highly considered, well-informed and well-written; an article on amoxicillin might be stub-class, just a few links to antibiotic, rheumatic fever, medicine, and conditions for which it is or is not indicated. I think that there is much room for improvement and expansion, particularly in sections regarding law, human rights, agriculture, NGOs, international organizations, etc. 

Here, then, is my suggestion for a new start.

I would certainly say that it's fair to assume that the president of one country (say, Fiji) is less globally important that the president of another country (say, China). A person who can have an immediate effect on the life of anyone in the world, by being the leader of a country with great economic and military power, would seem extremely relevant. In terms of that, if there is only to be one, it should probably be the current US president. I would suggest having him on the list as such, rather than as an individual. Apart from being president of the USA, George W Bush is almost certainly not ""top 1000 articles"" grade.

This remark dates back to April 2006. How is the progress of the list? Is it somewhat reliable?

At the moment we are discussing at the German article whether we should translate this page to the German article. We have currently defined the article as a list of the 1000 articles, an encyclopedia should contain. Every list entry is already an article that exists. Our goal is that most of them should be at least a good article. Currently 55 of them are featured and 103 are good articles. Unfortunately, we have some problems. Some categories contain too many articles, some contain too few.

So I just wanted to look how the state of the list is here on meta and compare it with the German WP. Best regards, --"

Might I suggest replacing Wilde with a woman, which are wholly under-represented (Virginia Woolf, perhaps?), or an American, which are lacking a bit, as well (Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Frost)?

I love Woolf, but say, either Virginia Woolf. She is not the best person who represent early 20th C English literature, either  Broomsbury or ""current of consciousness"". For the former, I would say Russel, and for the latter, Joyce. And we have already Yeats for this period. 
Generally I don't think it a good way to use this list as promoting someone or something ""under-represented"". Whether something is under-represented or not is highly a POV matter or not? So it is my POV but on the current list English authors are too over-represented. We have only three Roman poets, two German speaking authors (Goethe and Kafka), three French authors. Honestly I love Frost as a poet, but regarding the influence to  the literature, I think he has no precedence before other language great authors like Schiller, Rablais or Petrarca ... --"

 Articles for both :en:China and :en:People's Republic of China? Let's pick one.
If we have :en:Burj Dubai, we can delete :en:CN Tower and :en:Sears Tower. I also say delist :en:Petronas Twin Towers.

 I'm unsure about :en:Protist.
 I'm not sure if we need :en:Mobile telephone if we already have :en:Telephone
 I'm not sure about :en:Madonna and :en:Michael Jackson
 The 1990-91 :en:Gulf War seems pretty lame compared to the current conflict there.
 Why :en:Montreal, :en:Toronto, :en:Vancouver and :en:Chicago? They are important, but there are more significant cities in North America, and we already have several examples in the west.
 Do we need all three: Microeconomics, Macroekonomics, and Economics? I say, narrow it down to just :en:Economics and throw out the other two.
 :en:Syntax could maybe be covered in :en:Grammar
 If we have :en:Addiction, do we need ""drug addiction"" and ""alcoholism""?
 Who in the heck is :en:Verner Geisenberg? On the list, and no article in the English or German?
 Probably can delete :en:Stephen Harper, but maybe keep :en:John A. Macdonald.
 I'd like to see George Lucas and Steven Spielberg dropped for maybe someone from a different culture... Who's the best, most legendary director of ""Bollywood""? (Not my area of expertise.)

 Why do we have :en:Rock and roll and :en:Hard rock. I think we should have the more general :en:Rock music which encompasses both. I'm waffly about :en:Electronic music. Should we open up this list to styles of music based on instrument types? If so, en:Orchestra seems like a better choice.
 We have several examples of European Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Rubens, Bruegel, da Vinci, Donatello, Dürer, Raphael...  Can we trim it down to four or five? While we're there, I'd remove en:M. C. Escher, even though I like his stuff. It's just not groundbreaking enough for this list.
 There's overlap with :en:Sex, :en:Sexual reproduction, and :en:Sexual intercourse. I think we should keep the first, more basic article. While we're at it, we can probably remove :en:Penis and :en:Vagina (tee hee tee hee) but keep :en:Reproductive system. --"

The current version says ""I therefore suggests.."" at the beggining. While I appreciate the person who came up with this idea, I would suggest that the page avoid first person. 

It was not clear if everyone was invited to edit mercilessly. So I would suggest that there would be some clarifications on that. Only addition is welcome? Or, as one of the comments suggest here, only a desginated editor is welcome? 

I can boldly bring my own bias, but still it seems a bit too difficult to be NPOV. I would suggest that the page declares that this is just a list to consider, or to start from, but people are free to modify as they see relative importance of things in their language-culture(s). I would also encourage people to make feedback and bring their own perspectives to improve the list. 

A guideline to create a good list would also be helpful. Regarding biography, for example, ""the 100 most influential figures and those who are recognized to have made greatest achievements,"" etc."

We could simply link to all titles at simple, but then there would be no progress meter. I've done a test at :simple:User:Sverdrup/list_test to see how many articles of the list we have.

Then there is another question: Should we pull attention to this project and push it? We have a large workforce at en-wikipedia, and if we invite them to write 1000 useful, simple-englished stubs, we can get the simple-part of the project done in a rush.

Also, working on Czech translation, I find I would appreciate much if entries had, besides the link to simple: if there is one, always a separete link to real en: article that would be directly accessible for translation etc. Couldn't somebody write a script to add them? It would also help discover mistakes: (w:Edmund Hillary had two L, and BTW I would remove him - he isn't much important for the development of mankind, IMO rather Eurocentric, w:Eva Perón should have an accute accent etc. (I don't want to edit the list, I did so just now and it could be joint with working some more of my comments in).

Does anybody know the exact number now?

I strongly support removal of entries for individual colours - really, what can you say, ""roses are red""?

What is the point of the Boat/Ship dichotomy? (See above: If I could just click, I wouldn't be asking now).

After that, you can write about what's actually important for your language and the area it's spoken."" This might be slightly different from the intended message.

I know the project is not finished yet, but the new Wikipediae are not going to wait for it to be finished. If you want to help, change the page to offer them help right now, even if it's currently somewhat incomplete and suffering from Western bias, and find a way to offer it to the current, and future, small wikipediae. The whole Wikipedia project improves by step-wise refinement; the same can hold for this Minipedia."

Some Wikipedias changed this list and removed the Anglo-centricism of this list. Even a Wikipedia with over 10,000 articles found many black pages on this list when they intrlduced this list into their projects. You find a good example of the usage of this list (and improvement) on Italian Wikipedia. --

Regarding the Italian Wikipedia: No, I wouldn't. I would just find Italian words there. It's this page that should demonstrate its use, not some specific Wikipedia. But even more, it should probably be the supporters of this project who bring it to the small Wikipediae, rather than having it sit here until someone runs accross it.
Because some Wikipedias are interested in developing this list locally and not synching with this original list. This list appeared in the early summer of 2004. It has been developed here and there. In my observation most of editors like to improve it locally (after copying into their own project) not to remove it from this list directly. If you want to see Italian version or Japanese version, please visit those project. Aphaia.

(If a 10.000 wikipedia lacks a lot of the articles on this list, does that say something about the Wikipedia, or about the list?)"

This list suggested a standard on-line encyclopedia should have so-and-so articles (someone oppose certain articles but the idea itself might be approved; there are certain core concepts necessary to build up an encyclopedia). Some new Wikipedias, like Asturian, have utilized this list effectively. But older Wikipedia have grown according to interest of participants, not systhematially, so it is not strange a large Wikipedia lacks some entries of this list. Sometimes it reflects a cultural bias of contributors (a European language Wikipedia has large number of Europe-related topics but small on Asia related topics, vise versa) or just the characteristics of Wikipedians (for example, if no contributor is skilled on medicals or biology, it is hard to make a good article on Anatomy). --

And where some Wikipedias might use it as a useful checklist, to be effective the project needs to offer a whole bunch of small articles from the start. Look, like this: Minipedia, Talk:Minipedia.

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	1	Caesarion	12:58, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)	my opinion, Amsterdam IS important and well-known enough to be included in the list. Brussels is on it, so why not Amsterdam? It might even be better known among people oytside Western Europe than Brussels. The city of Amsterdam is bigger than the city of Brussels (though smaller than the state of Brussels). Jerusalem, being smaller as well, is also included. I will put it back now and I beg people not to remove it unless they have a very good reason to do so.--
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	2	Hapsiainen	15:51, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)	"I really thought that your edit was a joke or a test if anyone watches this article, because your edit summary sounded like that. More comments: Brussels is in the list because of its governmental (EU) importance. Jerusalem is in the list because it is an important city in the Abrahamic religions. Do you have any other reason for the inclusion than the size? If not, then we would also had to add e.g. Birmingham, Budapest and plenty of other cities because they are larger than Amsterdam. (en:Largest cities of the European Union by population and en:Largest urban areas of Western Europe) The list would grow too much and lose its value. ""Better known"" is a subjective reason. -"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	3	Aphaia	18:13, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)	Agreed. I removed it again because I think you didn't show the reason. You only said you had a reason but it was unclear for us what kind of reason. --
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	4	Aliter	19:41, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)	This is the sort of thing I wanted to avoid. The time spent on arguing whether Amsterdam should have been on the list, could have been used to actually write an article about Amsterdam.I've now rewritten Minipedia as an actual project. I invite you all to write Minipedia pages (500 char. max.) about Amsterdam and Brussels, and to vote for the page you find more important. The pages will be ordered according to the votes.
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	5	Hapsiainen	22:41, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)	This isn't about writing articles ourselves, this is what articles we recommend the others to write. You have missed the point of this page. -
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	6	Aliter	13:54, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)	The article can be read in more than one way, but the now archived top of this discussion page really discussed the place of the stub-like article to go with the list. But regardless, come write an article on Brussels: How long can it take you to write 500 characters or less on where it is, what it's the capital of, and what it is best known for. As soon as you do, any Wikipedia can use that as a starting point, even if they've never heard of Brussels.
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	7	Caesarion	11:59, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)	Well, Hapsiainen, your arguments certainly do make sense. However, I had other reasons than size to include Amsterdam. First, ask a thousand Americans, Chinese, Japanese or Argentines or whatever non-Europeans if they know Amsterdam, Brussels, Budapest or Birmingham. I would be very surprised if Amsterdam did not do best of those four. Second, for a long time it had more significance than Brussels. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Brussels was important (and during the MA far more so than Amsterdam), but not more significant than competitors like Brugues, Liege and Antwerp, successively. Amsterdam, in the seventeenth century, did exceed its neighbours in size and significance by far, and was the third town in Europe (after London and Paris), and indeed one of the biggest seaports. Similarly, The Netherlands during this so called Golden Age were a powerful entity and a serious competitor for France and England. Please consider this, and then consider including Amsterdam again. This will do for now.--

But there are some more cities I miss. Maybe we should expand the list to some 50 elements. I do not think that would be too big an inflation for the towns that are already on it (and of all of which I agree they must be maintained. I think these cities, apart from Amsterdam, would be useful to be included:

Alexandria, Baghdad, Buenos Aires, Casablanca, Delhi, Johannesburg, Kyoto, Lahore, Lima, Nairobi, Nanking, Prague, San Francisco and São Paulo. Many of these are more urgent than Amsterdam, as both Africa and South America are underrepresented with only one city.--"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	9	Aphaia	05:18, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)	Disagreed on expansion to 50. There are almost 200 entries to each country already. That is one five of this list (this list will provide 1,000 basic entries to start points to build an encyclopedia). For this purpose 250 entries to cities and countries seem however too many: one fourth of the list: we have to list other things, like science related matters, historical events, and so on. On the other hand, it is a nice proposal this list has to have some cities additionally, but some of cities your listed couldn't be included in the reason the above, I think. --

I find it a bit sad that that will not happen as part of thís project, but there may prove to be advantages to such a two-track approach. Still, as the discussion here clearly shows the cultural(?) gaps are not easy to bridge, I hope everyone here will on occasion spend a few minutes on Wikimedia, if only to vote for what they consider an article all languages must have. But of course, Wikipedia functions best when articles are written, so I can only hope some also can spare five minutes to write or improve a stub article on a subject they feel is important. And to tie up the last loose end: The answer to Aphaila's question is on the Minpedia page.
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	4	Amsterdam	14	Davidstrauss	00:43, 4 May 2005 (UTC)	Why should we have a minipedia when we can just create an index of articles in the simple English Wikipedia? I don't see how the length, complexity, or topics of articles should differ between the two.

This would better prove that these articles are expected in most wikis, because it already exists in lots of cultures. So why not starting by getting interwiki statistics from English Wikipedia (with which most other wikis have made interwiki links, the other links being much longer to propagate between other wikis), and from a few other major wikis in the top-10 (to avoid the bias in favor of occidental culture, i.e. European languages written with the Latin script, where some important topics are well covered for example in most Asian wikis, but not very well in occidental ones).
 So I would suggest checking the list of interwiki links with at least the major languages of each major script: English, German, French, Spanish and Portuguese (Latin-written), Chinese (Han-written), Russian (Cyrillic written), Arabic, Hindi (Devanagari-written), and create an effort so that these top lists are unified by resolving and completing interwikis between them. This should be a permanent maintenance effort to check that this list of top-interwikified articles synchonized in those wikis. In some cases, you will notice that a singlewiki has lots of interwikis to some regional languages, but not in other major wikis. The solution is to create at least the article stubs in the other major interwikis, to import the interwikis (the creation of stubs in other major wikis can't be automated, but a bot can still maintain a list of most-wanted articles in these wikis, and cite the other major wiki which has the greatest number of interwikis).
 All interwikis found in major wikis should be counted (including interwikis to regional languages)
 This list should be updated regularly (monthly?), because of ongoing efforts and evolution on all projects. There are already existing tools to help this maintenance task, notably the interwiki checker tool.
 If the list becomes too large, another useful statistic can be used to help sorting it: onecancount the number of links with ""Special:whatlinkshere"" on the major wikis.
 For now, the proposed list is clearly too much biased in favor of US-English culture, and there are lots of more important subjects to cover (for example, is it really needed to have ""Marylin Monroe"" in all wikis? I don't think so, this subject is really secondary for Arabic or Chinese users, and local culture really have their own ""stars"" that don't match the US profile.) Verdy_p 21:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
 In my opinion the idea of choosing by (possibly weighted) number of interwiki links sounds like an ingenious way to generate a nonbiased list. --"

The women in the category should remain on the list, but they should be filed under their respective categories. Separating the women implies that gender is more important than their accomplishments. The grouping also creates issues for figures like ""Rosa Parks,"" who, while a woman, mostly fought for racial minority rights. Why focus on her womanhood when she focused more on her African heritage? The women on the list who worked for women's rights should be grouped under ""human rights"" or a new ""women's rights"" category."

Sappho, Marie Curie, Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria, Cleopatra and Catherine the Great would definitely be listed, although they were in other sections. I don't know about all the listed women enough to say if they were important enough. Here is my idea of new addition: Harriet Taylor should be next to John Stuart Mill. She influenced his works a great deal, John Stuart Mill wrote that it is impossible to say which part of them is from her, which part from him. And Murasaki Shikibu must be there, because ""The Tale of Genji"" is allegedly the first novel in the world. -"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	7	"Necessity of ""women in history"" section"	5	67.10.131.229	06:22, 13 July 2005 (UTC)	"I agree with both sides here. Yep, it's possible. On the one hand, it's helpful to have a section that focuses on women *trailblazers*, those who may not have been able to change the entire world, but certainly made headway for their gender before more enlightened times, as Caesarian said. 

I.e. Elizabeth Blackwell did not find the cure for cancer, and therefore is not on the same level as Pasteur, for instance... but she was one of the first women to become an MD and practice medicine in the US; Mary Lyon likewise transformed education by opening Mount Holyoke college, arguably the first college for women. Yes, women outnumber men now in medical school, and in colleges and universities - but half a century ago (which is a blip in human history), women couldn't attend Princeton, Amherst, Dartmouth or enter the University of Michigan student union by the front door! 

But the others are also right in that women who *have* made a significant impact, regardless of their gender, need to be normalized in the rest of the work - eg Marie Curie, Queen Elizabeth I, Jane Austen, etc. If I may further editorialize, these articles are going to be read by girls *and* boys. It irritated me to learn later in life that all the interesting women who had done work in science and the arts were often covered only in ""women's history"" work, or footnoted because their work covered ""feminine"" pursuits, eg Mary Cassatt painted women and kids, so her work wasn't ""serious"" - pfft - but imagine the young men who utilize this information, and get the wrong impression about what women have achieved and are capable of. Many young men aren't going to be dawdling around a ""women's history"" section, but will be more interested to read about a woman who studied and achieved in their own field."
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	7	"Necessity of ""women in history"" section"	6	PetrochemicalPete	03:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)	"Isn't listing women separately an affront and offence to that which they strove to achieve? Wasn't the original problem that women were perceived as different, lesser and not able to compete with men on an equal footing that they were oppressed into segregation in all things? Wouldn't segregating women into their own separate list be a further discriminatory offence? Doesn't it give the impression that they are listed because of their sexual organs rather than because of their work? Won't this mean that when someone chooses to look up ""mathematicians"" or ""scientists"" they will find an entirely male only list because women have been moved into their own separately ""lesser category"" of not being quite as important for what they did, as their importance for being able to give birth to children? Is not the whole entire purpose, rationale and spirit of the equality they fought so hard to achieve, the very fact that special treatment - positive or negative - ceases to exist? That all great mathematicians are great mathematicians for their mathematical prowess (end of story), not ""he was great, despite being black"" or ""she achieved many things in a relative sense, considering she was just some lowly woman without a brain""?

Sorry but I'm unable to find this to be a trivial issue. Because it seems to undo what they worked to achieve, it appears to restore the very injustice that some of them risked and sacrificed their lives to rectify, by calmly putting the women away in a separate little box where they can't do any harm. That the women are ""kept"" to one side, away from the serious stuff of the men. This is simply wrong on many levels. It saddens me to see that such prejudice still exists to still insist on keeping women out of ""men's affairs"". It perpetuates the injustice. These women were great. Not great because they were women. But great because they were human beings who achieved great things.

Put the mathematicians in the mathematician category. No, I didn't say put the women mathematicians in the male mathematician's category. I said put all the mathematicians of whatever gender, skin colour, disability or whatever else in the mathematicians category because that what they were. Anything else is prejudice and prejudice was the very injustice many of these women wrongly suffered and fought against. You insult them by listing them separately, in my humble view. It mocks them. 

Regards the women who's achievements were specifically in the cause of women's rights then add them to a ""human rights"" category and list them there (alongside Rev.Martin Luthor King). Think about it. You're listing the women differently because you're listing them by what they are. For everyone else, they are being listed by what they achieved. That's not equal treatment. 

Further, I'd point out that this is a major violation of NPOV too, from a practical point of view. Please can this be voluntarily corrected on agreement of principle. I'm sure it's unintentional but, as it stands, this separate list for women is a form of mockery of them. An insult to exactly that which they fought so hard against. It gives out entirely the wrong message. Men are listed as ""mathematician"" or ""physicist"". Women are listed as ""women"". Putting them to one side and keeping them away from the ""real"" stuff. It's just not on. Not on at all."

I've just noticed that at least Cleopatra exists twice in the list. This has been no doubt caused by this sexist double standard in the categorisation. Orwellian double-think. Cleopatra is added because she's a woman to the ""harmless little box away from reality we put women in"" mockery list. Then she's added elsewhere correctly for her historical importance. The duplication has been caused exactly because of what I was saying above that the rest of the list is by achievement but the women are listed by what they are. That's two modes of contradictory classification at the same time, which logically overlap, and it's hardly surprising that it has driven contributors to error, asking them to quite literally maintain a double-standard (as that is what the term double-standard directly refers to) in adding names to the list. I can see that this is meant with goodwill in order to avoid under-representation of women but this is too much of an over-compensation that's leading to error and comes across as belitting and mocking. Which I'm sure was the opposite of the original good but misguided intention for the ""special list""."

It is not. I note that no-one has complained of Adolf Hitler being on the list. But you could not have anyone more anti-semitic than the systematic murderer of 6 million Jews, who was intent on no less than complete genocide (and not only of Jews alone either). No-one mentions the listing of Adolf Hitler because it's understood that an article on Hitler is not an endorsement of anything he did. It is understood that the preservation of the Auschwitz concentration camp as a Holocaust museum is not an endorsement of the Holocaust. But, on the contrary, a means to ensure future generations are aware of what happened that no such thing ever transpires on this Earth ever again. A biography of Hitler can act as a warning to future generations because Hitler did play on people's fears and charm them with his euphamistic rhetoric to get himself voted into power to commit his evil crimes. Should another Hitler rise, pray otherwise, then education of the people about Hitler and the Holocaust is the means by which it never happens again. Because the people will learn to recognise the rhetoric and see through any charm or euphamism to what such people really are, denying them power or any means to carry out their genocides.
This list is a minimum list, not a maximum list. The appearance of an article (such as that on Adolf Hitler or George W. Bush or Osama bin Laden) does not represent any form of endorsement or celebration of the person. As always, every article should be NPOV. Those on persons that of neutral biography. That of concept, netural explanation. 
This is further reason to normalise and eradicate the special ""women"" section because this is positive discrimination and might be partially responsible for the false perception that this is a list of celebration and endorsement, rather than a neutral list of neutral articles (based only on historical or cultural significance, be it good or bad). I understand that some cultures feel that the positive discrimination by segregation of women or blacks is some form of compensation for previous injustices against them. But this is not the place for that and it only introduces a confusing double-standard. Some articles are given a special section of ""positive celebration"" on the strength of what someone is / was, while every other article follows a different classification of neutral listing on the strength of what they did (in purely NPOV historical significance terms). This double standard is conspiring to ruin this list, introducing a confusion as to how our classification is being derived."

This would help with inconsistencies between the tables, too. We just need to make sure the talk page doesn't turn into multi-lingual babble. I can read (and write to a good degree) German, so I can help with the two biggest Wikipedias. I would do pages by language family to foster communication and have far less than 100 columns. A Germanic language page, a romance language page, etc. Every page would still need EN and SIMPLE because they're sort of the foundations. A different strategy would be to do one page for the top Wikipedias and some subdivision for the rest. 100 columns would be unreadable. Maybe this calls for a dynamic, non-wiki tool.

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	15	 Added literature section; changed another section to social scientists 	0	67.10.131.229	06:59, 13 July 2005 (UTC)	"Before, there was a section on ""writers and thinkers,"" heavy on the philosophers and social scientists, with a few dudes like Shakespeare and Alighieri thrown in. The social science of how and why we are, is a bit different than the literature and drama showing us who we are, so to speak.  I tried to come up with a list of people who are still influential today, or who led a great literary movement, but it's heavy on American and European writers. Since there might be some arguments, I want to first back up why I chose what I did:

 Isaac Asimov (prolific, popularized science fiction and science for many readers; also, member of the seminal Futurians, a 20th century group of science fiction fans who went onto greatness in their fields)
 Jane Austen (novels and romances, in the literary sense, differ in that novels are supposed to be realistic/true to life, romances are not; which is why Jules Verne and HG Wells were said to write ""scientific romances"" even though they weren't about necking lovers. Anyway - the gist - Austen changed the format of novels, she was one of the first to write about love, family and money;  and her work was not crap, unlike most of the novels circulating at that time in lending libraries.)
  Bertolt Brecht (broke the fourth wall; explicitly ideological)
 Lord Byron (Romanticism) 
 F. Scott Fitzgerald (epitomizing the Lost Generation, post WWI)
 Hildegard of Bingen (a polymath who was influential in both music, religious and secular writing)
 Victor Hugo (Romanticism)
 Edgar Allan Poe (furthering horror, gothic, short stories)
 Jean-Paul Sartre (existentialism)
 Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (creating the horror/science fiction genre)
 Murasaki Shikibu (first novelist, as stated earlier)"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	16	 Why so few?  why were some of these important women bios hidden? 	0	67.10.131.229	08:51, 13 July 2005 (UTC)	"Okay, I've come in late here, but I'm surprised at what's been left out in several key areas. Musicians (which I added composers to) is very short (5 people?), there are three times as many computer scientists listed, there are no military leaders in bios (although Osama bin Laden gets to be listed as a terrorist), and many pivotal women have been edited out with formatting. 

Bottom line - is the point really to limit everything to a set number of articles, even if it leaves out someone or some topic that's important? 

The women in history (debated above) list is especially limited. With some of the omissions made with editing (the only section in which this is rampant - with 10 names hidden ... with none of the names appearing in other lists)... did someone omit the people because they were not convinced of their importance, or did not know who they were, and assumed that they were not important?

Ie. Amelia Earhart is on the list, although she is more famous now for her disappearance than her disputed gift for flying ... (Amy Johnson, Nancy Love, Jackie Cochran arguably did more for women in aviation AND were known as better pilots) but Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Helen Keller are now hidden?   Truth and Tubman were two of the most important people, period, in the American abolition movement and 19th century America, with Tubman the ""Moses"" of the Underground Railroad. I could understand omitting Truth because her fame was largely as a speaker; but Tubman's achievement is unique. Essential? yes, to American and African history. 

I note also that there are a dearth of Africans and African-Americans on the list, period. The point here is not to be ""politically correct,"" but to cover people who would be key to any encyclopedia of the world. A reader might find Stravinsky jarring to the ear, for instance, but there's no doubt that he had an incredible influence on modern music, and thus would appear as a major bio in any section on music. (Although he doesn't appear here in the list of five musicians...)

Meanwhile, no one has ever come close to publicizing the experience and special needs of the disabled as Helen Keller - without benefit of sight or sound. It's extraordinary that someone would want to omit her. 

Also hidden was Emma Goldman, an influential socialist; Germaine Greer has been eclipsed, while ""Feminine Mystique"" author Betty Friedan, as well as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, are not even listed ... but world leaders Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir stay on?"

She was mostly active in ineffectively promoting socialism. She doesn't deserve special inclusion just because she was severely disabled. And, sorry, but Tubman's underground railroad work does not qualify as African history any more than my family's graphic arts work (which happened in America) counts as Hungarian or Russian history. African history is, by definition, what happens in Africa. Only the slave capturing or initial transport would qualify. Otherwise, you're using a double standard where African history follows former Africans but European history doesn't follow former Europeans. Finally, approaching the list from the perspective ""Are there enough women?"" is intellectually dishonest. We should be looking at facets of the human existence and deciding on who (or what) affected each area most, not forcefully including women so this list has its own affect. Affirmative action isn't NPOV. --"

On :als: for example (Alemannic; there are no speakers of Alemannic who do not also read and write German), I will not be motivated to write about Nelson Mandela or Leif Ericsson, since anybody can read about them on :de: or :en:, while topics of regional Swiss or Swabian notability are much more likely not to be on one of the 'big' 'pedias.

 Furthermore it might be considered, that such a Wikipedia may reveal facts, yet unknown by scientists, that are important for wider areas. So the remarks about plants by Brokesales in the Saterfrisian Test-Wikipedia (see request) may be of importance for the etymology of plant-names.

An article on homosexuality does not imply it should be pro-homosexuality

People's Republic of China recently declared that homosexual behaviour is not a disorder, as have some other countries.  But not every country in the world has done so, or is ready to do so.  If you ask every language to have an article on the subject, some of them are going to be a little more frank, and not as flattering, as others might like!  Those wikis represent cultures that would probably just as soon not have such an article in the first place, since the body of their knowledge, that they are trying to capture here, is not relevant to it.

Did you realize that at no time in history have all cultures shared the same ""body of knowledge""?  There have always been areas that one culture had better knowledge of, like medicine, etc.  This is true even today.  That's what makes wikipedia so important, and really, the next step of the internet.  Never before has such exchange and correlation of data as a group effort been feasible.  Especially for the ""smaller"" languages, such a tool can prove valuable in promoting diversity, and even in rejuvenating the vitality of the language by providing a databank for each language's speakers to take stock of its entire field.  In respecting diversity, we must respect that diverse cultures have diverse directions and methods and outlooks; we must not even dream of attempting to use lists like this one as a tool to enforce that ""everyone is on the same page"" as YOU happen to be on, especially with controversial agendas. Such attempts would only backfire, and would likely be viewed as a monster coming from afar through the lagoon to swallow one's city."

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	18	 Inclusion of homosexuality 	10	PetrochemicalPete	14:42, 25 October 2005 (UTC)	"Alan Turing, a mathematician who's work is the foundational principles upon which all computers operate and who was highly instrumental in helping to break the Nazi Enigma code, was a homosexual. At this time, homosexuality was also illegal in Britain (this is no longer the case) and Turing was arrested for illegal homosexual practices. He was experimented upon (as it was deemed that homosexuality was a disease and they used living human beings as guinea pigs to try to find a means to ""cure"" their homosexuality), to the point where he committed suicide by biting into an apple laced with cyanide preferring death to their experimentations.

This is historical fact. The history and eventual death of this man is bound up to his homosexuality. It is not possible to provide a proper biography of this man without referencing to the fact that he was a homosexual. Therefore, the question becomes should Alan Turing be edited out of certain wikipedias completely in order to censor his homosexuality?

Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, Turing developed the foundational mathematical basis of computer science. In artificial intelligence, the basic test of whether to classify a machine as intelligent or not was defined by Turing and is therefore named after him, called ""the Turing Test"". In the very foundational theory of computers, there is something called ""Turing equivalence"" which defines whether a machine conforms to being a ""universal Turing machine"". Together with Church, there is also the ""Church-Turing theory"". Because he was so instrumental in developing the underlying mathematical theory of computers, it basically becomes impossible to discuss the subject without mentioning Turing.

Therefore, the question becomes whether such censorship should cascade? If Turing is not included and not allowed to be mentioned for his homosexuality then a great many computer science articles must also be removed. If computer science articles are removed then on what basis can articles explaining what hardware and software is be written (when the definition rests heavily on Turing's shoulders)?

If homosexuality is not allowed to exist then Turing can't be allowed and if he is not allowed then computer science disappears. This is only considering one homosexual man. There were many more and goodness knows what other large sections of wikipedia disappear, if they are edited out.

Looking at it solely as a practical matter, the difficulty is that homosexuals might or might not be regarded as perverts by certain individuals and cultures. But they still have contributed to the body of human knowledge and achievement. If we cannot provide biographies of these people because these must include the facts of their homosexuality then how can any contributions they've made to the world be referenced? If you cut off the wrist then the whole hand is also cut off too.

Further, in sections on nature, are we to edit out the fact that many species of animal besides humans are known to engage in homosexual activity? It is factual from observation that homosexuality occurs perfectly naturally across all sexually reproducing species. You might deem such observable evidence as pro-homosexuality that it should not be included. Therefore, you ask an encyclopedia to not just censor information but also change the facts from their reality to your chosen fantasy, simply to suit your moral preferences.

In many countries and cultures, male homosexuality is illegal but no laws exist regards female homosexuality (infamously in British history, a past Queen disbelieved that lesbianism could even exist and, by this, female homosexuality was never illegal at any point, even when male homosexuality was made illegal). Therefore, we must ask the question of you: Could an article on homosexuality exist if it only makes reference to female homosexuality or to observations of natural homosexuality in animals? In every country and culture I know of, animals are deemed incapable of being charged with a crime. Their homosexuality is not guided by any known conscious endeavour and neither is it in any way illegal.

You would also need to clarify the exact details of this policy. Is it the act of sodomy which is the perversion or sexual attraction to a person of the same sex? Because if it is the act of sodomy then must we also censor the anatomical fact that the female clitoris partially extends into the anal area that heterosexual sodomy would be a perversion for the same reason? Even if it is factual and completely naturally occurring, the factual truth must be altered and ommitted?

The Ancient Greeks practised homosexuality as a bizarre form of contraception (a relationship with another man satisfying sexual urges but with no risk of pregnancy, as they would have with sex with their wives). It was considered in no means perversion or illegal in that ancient culture. It's not entirely known who did what to whom but names such as Pythagoras (his theorems are fundamental to geometry and the Western scale of music is based on his mathematics. Geometry is fundamental to topology. Topology is fundamental to chaos theory. Chaos theory is fundamental to weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. Geometry is fundamental to Einsteinian relativity. Relativity is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology. Edit this man out of history because he might have engaged in homosexual activity and you catapult human knowledge straight back to prehistory), Aristotle (which kills the scientific method and, therefore, all of science in its entirety), Socrates, Plato (no Atlantis mythology, his Republic never written), Archimedes (yet more mathematics, water displacement, engineering disappears), Euclid (nevermind, that's just killed mathematics completely) and so forth.

Like it or not, people who've engaged in homosexual activity have contributed massively to the pool of human knowledge, science and technology (if not directly then by ""Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"", as Newton called it, that one science depends on another, one technology on another that if you hack away the tree's root then the whole tree falls).

From a practical point of view, whether the homosexuality is placed in a positive or negative light, it cannot be ignored and it cannot be edited out or altered to a truth that it not born out by the observable natural evidence without committing an act of intellect dishonesty. None of which abandons a NPOV at any point to make a single moral judgment on homosexuality itself. 

If you wish your policy to be accepted then it is only prudent that you supply the necessary exacting details of what is objectionable, what should be done specifically and what-not for policy review. So that the exact justification can be reviewed before we tell you to **** off."

First of all, I have never in this conversation discussed ""editing out"" any existing articles.  I merely stated that certain language wikipedias may have better things to write about than the article ""homosexuality"", and by no means should they be coerced or pressured into having such an article.  It does not logically follow from that that there would necessarily be no references to famous homosexuals whatsoever on that wiki.  And that last paragraph is very arrogant of you, because it assumes that there is a body of pro-homosexual people in control here, who have authority over me, and that I have to attempt to justify myself to before they tell me to ""**** off"".  I recognise no such authority or hierarchy here, and if you do tell me to **** off, I likely won't.  Just so you know.  I have every bit as much right to stay here here as you do, Pete, and just because I recognise homosexuality to be deviant, does not give you the right to exclude me for my opinion that you happen to disagree with.  

 Each wikipedia must be independent and set its own criteria internally as regards POV / NPOV, and not have it dictated to them by a tiny left wing group, if this project is to remain credible to most people.

 Oh yeah, and as long as I'm still entitled to my opinion, I don't feel sorry for the guy who bit the apple one little bit."
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	18	 Inclusion of homosexuality 	12	PetrochemicalPete	01:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)	" The exclusion of an article on homosexuality is exactly a conscious means of editing the information provided. It would introduce non-netural systematic bias to the information, violating NPOV. For example, if I consciously made the decision to write about Darwinian evolution but then insisted I had better things to do than write about the corresponding Creationism from all the religions of the world then  that would be a case of systematic bias against Creationism. Note that subjects such as genetic algorithms in artificial intelligence are based on an adaptation of evolutionary theory (the same mechanisms of evolutionary theory are re-applied to an artificial situation, in order to ""evolve"" practical answers to complex problems by emulating nature's method of doing so). Implicitly, the mechanisms succesfully exploited in genetic algorithms are an (artificial) evolution in microcosm and therefore you can't cover this subject without either writing of evolutionary theory in general and linking to that or, if it is deemed that evolution should be excluded for cultural reasons, that you end up writing about all the mechanisms of evolutionary theory inside the article on genetic algorithms (and it is left up to the reader to back-trace that if it factually works to useful purpose in this artificial situation then it's existence in nature, to one degree or another, must be guaranteed. Note, as an example that this is not necessarily contradictory and I'm remaining NPOV, the last Pope John Paul II gave recognition to the existence of the evolutionary process, whilst retaining his religion's Creationist beliefs). Further, we have subjects such as genetics, memetics, the Human Genome project and others which again are dependent at least historically on evolutionary theory.

 If we allow this on homosexuality then you open the flood gates. Creationists can systematically bias evolutionary theory out of their wikipedias. Noting Rosa Park's sad death yesterday, racists could decide that they have better things to do and systematically bias blacks and the Civil Rights movement in America out of their wikipedia. Sexism could systematically bias all women out of the wikipedia (or place them in their own ""harmless"" section away from the men, creating a gender apartheid and double standard in the classification). 

 It exactly follows that if one article may be excluded by cultural belief then any and all ultimately could too. Logically, if the one is permitted then the others are justified by the same rationale. You say you have better things to do than include an article on homosexuality and this opens the flood gates that racists have better things to do than write about Rosa Park's death, sexists have better things to do than write about famous women, creationists have better things to do than write about evolution (or any of its dependents). This exactly logically follows. Unless you propose that only you are exempted with solely your beliefs while everyone else follows a different standard.

 You talk of arrogance but what if a different contributor to your language's wikipedia wants to include the article? You arrogantly presume that a language's country of origin has cultural rights over that language's wikipedia. What if I was to learn your language? Would I not have the right both to speak your language and the right to my own beliefs, here in the country I now reside where homosexuality is not illegal, to contribute to your language's wikipedia? Culture and language is most certainly linked in linguistical terms but it does not follow that all speakers of your language come under the authority of your lands, your laws and your cultural beliefs. 

 The reverse example is the perfect example. You converse with me here in English.  This does not mean that you come under the laws and culture of England, does it? In fact, with the use of English as a Lingua Franca globally as well as being the main language of more populous countries such as America then most people speaking English here would, on average, not come under the laws, culture or otherwise of England. It's  not that clear cut that your language defines your culture and laws. 

 If you are stating that language defines cultural immutably then this list is written in English. The laws of England do not hold homosexuality illegal. It stays on the English list by your own reasoning but feel free to drop it during translation to your ""culture"". Though it is very arrogant to assume all those who speak your language share your lands and culture. If I were to speak your language then there is no cultural or legal impediment to my contributing an NPOV article on homosexuality to your wikipedia.

 You also misunderstand my final humourous comment. I'm more than aware (as I've just tried to explain to you above) that wikipedia has no authority over its contributors whatsoever. Anyone may edit any page. If I learnt your language then I can contribute to your wikipedia and if you learnt mine then you could do the same in return. The wikipedias of all languages are not the possession of any culture or any religion or any land. There exists no authority here but reality (and the clauses of the GNU FDL). You misunderstand the nature of my comment that I was not suggesting you'd be overruled but I was suggesting that I believed you cannot factually prove your case for the exclusion of an NPOV article on homosexuality. My comment was conveying the pre-destined and pre-ordinained conclusion that your justification would prove to be lacking (which I base on my belief that you are simply wrong). I in no way meant that it wouldn't be fairly listened to (in fact, I exactly was encouraging you to compile your justification and present it. It is simply a personal belief that it would be lacking and your freedom of expression will be retained fully exactly because my beliefs do not override yours. But, by the same token, your beliefs do not override mine either). It is also merely a colloquialism to say ""**** off"", as I in no way meant to imply that you have no right to be here. On the contrary, I welcome you to stay and I am not of the politically correct mentality that I do not believe that you should be censored from expressing your opinion on any grounds. But I do believe personally that you are wrong. I presume you respect that I am just as entitled to that opinion and expressing it here as you are with your opinions, yes?

 But, in the interests of reaching consensus instead of simply fighting, you are in agreement that homosexuality exists? It might be deviant and illegal to promote it in your culture and jurisdiction but you do not deny its existance. Is that assertion correct? Then write an article on homosexuality that reflects this. Write an article which states that homosexuality is deviant and which does not promote it but condemns it. It is a subject which exists. You have a passion to write here of its deviancy. Then write the article in that exact same spirit. Consider that even though it may be illegal and deviant that your culture and country does have deviants and criminals, yes? Homosexuality exists and maybe others in your culture are homosexuals. You could consider the article to be information to the homosexual in your culture about why their behaviour is deviant. Help them back on the right path. Try to maintain an NPOV within the context of your culture (so if the prohibition on homosexuality comes from a Holy Text then quote this Text to do as an encyclopedia should in providing such details of when laws were passed, who passed the law and so forth) but, yes, write the article within the context of your culture.

 Is that a fair compromise? The article is not the promotion of homosexuality but its recognition as existing. You can look at it in the same light as writing an article about any other deviant behaviour. Murder is against the law but this does not mean that you cannot write an article about it. Would not an encyclopedia be the correct place for the law to be explained? How can people know and follow the law if it is not explained to them? If it is in the body of law then it must have been legally passed into law officially at some point. Write about the history of when this happened. That law must have an official definition of what does and doesn't constitute homosexual behaviour in the eyes of the law, so include that definition (if there are homosexuals in your culture then reading this article will tell them what they must or mustn't do to be keeping with the law, so you could consider it the upholding of the law).

 Is that compromise acceptable to you?"

Just because it is something that YOU practice, or that YOUR culture glorifies, and you claim to be ""civilised"" and ""progressive"", does not mean we are not going to resist your forceful spread of it by any means possible.  The 1% of the earth's surface where it is considered a ""good"" thing are the places where you have forced yourself, not where you have been welcomed, and we have noticed this and are determined to stop it.  Why don't you insist that all wikipedias have an article on bestiality while you're at it???  Every sngle argument you have used or can use in defense of the one, you can similarly use for the other.  What?  Does that disgust you???  Well that is how people in most countries look at your culture.  We don't want any part of it, and we do not want to devote articles to bestiality any more than homosexuality, just because those things exist in places where they are tolerated.  If you are still capable of thought, think about it for a moment and you will see I am right.  There are different standards in different regions of the world, you cannot impose your own local standard which is the lowest common denominator, across the board on the rest of us that have higher standards, and all I am doing is fighting against and resisting such cultural imperialism.  I am not saying we should delete the English article on homosexuality, because that is obviously what English speaking countries glory and revel in.  I'm just saying put your missionary agenda aside and leave it alone at this point, because it's only going to backfire in your face more than it has already."
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	18	 Inclusion of homosexuality 	14	PetrochemicalPete	07:30, 29 October 2005 (UTC)	" Rather than continuing fighting where neither of us are ever going to change our opinions, I've made a change to the list that it now lists ""sexuality"" rather than ""homosexuality"". This probably serves both of us better because, from my point of view, the failure to recognise heterosexuality and bisexuality (also, non-sexuality can exist as well as covering related issues of celebacy - religious and non-religious - plus even fetishism, swinging, threesomes, pornography. It's really a wider ""human issue"" than only homosexuality) would be as wrong as leaving out homosexuality. But, from your point of view, it's not promoting any particular sexuality (or, if you prefer to see it that way, ""deviancy""). Content can then be entirely neutral, as no more than explanation of what constitutes what, remaining purely informational. Adapt as necessary for your culture and laws (I still don't agree philosphically but if it is against the law of your land then we can't ask you to break the law and must recognise that on a pragmatic level).
 Would this serve as an acceptable compromise? Sexuality as a general concept. So it would also rightly include other forms of sexuality without bias. From heterosexuality to bisexuality to non-sexuality (rarely mentioned but some people really ain't interested, irrespective of gender). Also a convenient place to mention celebacy (both religious - monks or other religious equivalent - and cultural - no sex before marriage - and conscious decision - movements promoting celebacy as contraception / disease prevention in teenagers) or even monogamy / polygamy or fetishism, if an article wants to go that far into the subject. Drop or alter those sections which might be breaking your laws (though I still disagree philosophically, you can't be asked to break the law for the sake of one Wikipedia article).
 As I say, the more I think on this topic then listing only ""homosexuality"" isn't really meeting my approval either but for alternate reasons. There's a massive subject here and only mentioning one sexual preference does seem biased. The more I think, the more examples come to mind. For example, in some cultures, Mormon and some Arab, then polygamy - having many wives - isn't a problem or against the law. Does that not also deserve a mention as gay marriages in the Netherlands (who, alternatively, allow that but do not allow polygamous marriage)?
 If we take a wider view then that satisfies me more as it covers the subject properly in a NPOV way. While it gives you scope to edit as is appropriate to your culture's laws, so as not to be breaking them. I still retain my philosophical stance on the issue but, in the end, it's a pragmatic compromise of some kind that suits everyone which we actually need here. We also can't ask you to break the law, which must be recognised on a pragmatic level."

Also, the page should be moved ASAP from ""List of articles all languages should have"" - because the ambiguity of the English word should is proving misleading to many - to something more along the lines of ""List of 100 suggested starter topics for all languages"".  No one likes being told what they ""should"" do.  The whole idea of this page smacks of pure colonialism, and the idea that English speakers are smart enough to decide what the whole world needs to know about (like how many varieties of sexual deviance they can come up with, for example)... I'll bet if the list had been drawn up in Chinese or Hebrew or Turkish or Bushman, it would look somewat different."

Again, many people attribute language as equivalent to culture. It is not.
All of us here are speaking English because we need a medium through which to communicate with each other. English, for historical reasons (including, yes, past colonialism), has become the practical main Lingua Franca for international communication. Yes, not the sole one or the best one or anything else. This is just a practical fact for us to get this project done, it's not intended to be a judgement call or moral diktat or anything else of that nature.
This list is in English for the purposes of international distribution. A pragmatic reason only.
In other words, you can be an English speaker in any land, under any culture, with any set of beliefs and expert knowledge in any subject within the whole realm of human experience. 
This list, if anything, is entirely to encourage that diversity, not cut it off. But some language needed to be used for communication purposes. English happens to be the pragmatic choice. Not the only choice or a better choice (Esparanto might be less biased but I bet most of us can't communicate in it and it could still be accused of Eurocentricism anyway), but a purely pragmatic choice.
If it helps, I come here from the Welsh Wicipedia. We're the first (and likely to also be the last) colony of the English empire. In the past, the English tried to delibrately destroy the Welsh language and culture. The Welsh language has been fighting for survival against the invasion of the English language for centuries. 
From a cultural POV, I adopt the language of a colonial oppressor and past direct and active enemy of my culture and its language, solely to ensure that we might communicate with each other. It'd be nice to have that appreciated and that it's not assumed that there is a flat ""European culture"" with a singular ""conspiracy theory"" (a bizarre concept for what has the most diversity in the smallest area on the face of planet Earth, where nearly every country speaks its own separate language and where, as the EU shows, we rarely agree on even the most trivial of issues like units of measurement or whether we should or shouldn't have a constitution. Such suggestions, which I've also heard Americans express, frankly threatens being a paranoid delusion. The idea of a flat homogenous Western culture is a bit ridiculous too. Europe and America hardly come close to agreeing on everything either) or that it's automatically ""colonial"" or that you can claim to be the sole cultural ""victim"" that's ever existed.
Give and take. Showing understanding of others, even if tolerance or agreement can't be offered. That's how we make this work. And I do believe that this list can be fully made to work that all can agree on it and work together. That won't necessarily always be easy on contravertial issues but if we are willing, it is certainly possible. 
Disagreement is not in itself a problem. It's natural, it's expected and it's the whole ethos of the Wikipedian editing process, in fact. But we have to be flexible in dealing with that disagreement or it all grinds to a halt and that would suit none of us, right?"

But I feel this could make the best litmus paper test for which articles - especially regards cities and personalities - qualify. Then what this list comes to represent is a minimum set of core subjects of global significance that all wikipedias share because they are subjects that humanity and the world shares.

Jerusalem would pass the test because of its significance to the Abrahamic religions, which are global. Newton would pass the test because his work altered the scientific world and the perception humanity has had of its world globally since. I'd also say Rome would pass this test because through both the Roman Empire and later the Catholic Church, it is a location of global significance. Mathematics is completely universal so it passes the test without any hesitation at all. We're all human so human anatomy should be included.

The idea being that qualification of articles is based on its global significance. That  it is an article which deserves to be in every wikipedia regardless of language because it is a subject that has no less significance in one wikipedia than it does in any other.

Then this project could come to represent what could be considered a core of global subjects that are relevent to all of humanity, whatever language, whatever nationality, whatever religion. Which makes sense as a minimum list of articles to expect to be found in all wikipedias, irrespective of language. Those subjects to which everyone in the global village can relate to.

Note that this test would be tough in places because Bill Gates almost seems to qualify more than Rev. Martin Luthor King or Gandhi, in terms of only globality rather than notoriety or achievement. But I feel it both makes the most sense as the foundation for a set of core subjects that spans all languages by being those threads that bind us all together and also because it should involve less contraversy about which subjects to include and which to leave out. Subjects of global significance should be present in all wikipedias anyway. This list formalises that and makes a handy checklist for all contributors to ensure that the coverage on these basic global subjects is there.

The nature of this project seems implictly to be about binding our wikipedias and communities together that it seems to make sense to me that the subjects selected for the list share that exact same sentiment."

I presume that football world cup refers to the global international soccer event here (as it would be the Superbowl for American football, yes? And the Superbowl is not listed because it's not an international event, even if a very big deal inside America itself?).

If so, then shouldn't American football be listed, when the other American-origin sports baseball and basketball are there (even if this always represents potential confusion that football refers to different sports - e.g. American football, soccer, Australian rules football, etc. - they should still be listed if deserving of an article, of course)? 

And without wanting to introduce any politics to this, soccer is understood but is not its natural name in most locations of the world, where it's football. Soccer disambiguates, true, but it seems to threaten NPOV to not refer to it by its most neutral international name, which I believe would be football before soccer (though I may be wrong and would be happy to be put right on that. I'm not a sports fan and say this only with NPOV in mind, as I actually don't care personally which is used).

Also, gymnastics seems absent and wouldn't it be perhaps more universal to list martial arts rather than Judo specifically (or we risk an explosion of each martial art being listed individually e.g. Karate, Judo, Jujitsu, Kendo, etc.)?"

They both fit under these headings, since the topics overlap. However I think it is redundant to have a topic appearing twice, even if the topic heading implies different aspects which an article could cover.  After all, this is functioning as the first starter list, showing major arteries rather than every vein in the body! I wonder whether it would be useful to users of the list to have a cross-reference between different topics in brackets after the topic heading eg. ‘Resources (see also Technology/Electricity/Depletable energy sources and fossil fuels)’ and ‘Depletable energy sources and fossil fuels (see also Science/Resources) – but see amendments to Technology topic below. Then if an article heading appears only on one list the cross-reference may encourage the inclusion of the different aspects related to the different topic headings in the one article, without repeating the article title itself.

Food production is generally considered to be fundamental to human survival and development. This topic could potentially include the technology of agriculture, hunting, gathering, storage and cooking.  There should also eventually be a fair amount of overlap between this topic and the topics of ecology and food.

Harnessing energy has always been a major technological goal. This topic includes much that was included in ‘common technology’ and ‘electricity’. I found it a little misleading to have energy resources as a sub-heading of electricity when in fact all of the energy sources mentioned can be used as energy sources without having to be converted into electricity eg. windmill-operated water pumps, combustion engines.

By the way, how close is the list to hitting one thousand articles?"

I can also easily agree many of its contributors are US/UK/Commonwealth. However the list is way too much filled with Anglo-American people. I already suggested (sorry, forgot to register a user on meta) to replace Truman with Nuclear Bomb. Similarly people from the last 50-100-200 years should not be mandatory, let leave each Wiki-team to decide. Is G. W. Bush more important than French President Miteran, or founders of European Union less important than the founders of United States?

One can use something like ""Include at least five local rulers and five international heads of states, and describe them with 3 phrases"". --"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2005	24	 Criteria for inclusion - NPOV 	1	PetrochemicalPete	11:55, 24 January 2006 (UTC)	"But an important component of this project is also its capacity to increase interwiki links between individual Wikipedias. If each Wikipedia diverges from the list then we lose that interlingual linking and the whole purpose of standardising a set of ""core"" articles to be found in all Wikipedias.
Alternatively, I suggest that as we simultaneously have the problem of far too many cities and people on the list (the cities alone were taking up a fifth of the whole ""1000 articles"" limitation at one point) then we work to cut the list down to just those cities and people which arouse no cultural contraversy.
So, yes, is Bush really deserving in a wide historical and global context? Perhaps not and we should strike him from the list. Repeat with all cities and people in the list. Solving both our problems - too many articles about people and places, as well as articles whose inclusion is contravertial - at the same time.
To achieve this might take a lot of haggling and disagreement and editing, true. But isn't that somewhat the point of the Wikipedian editing process? Yes, the initial list was perhaps too American. Then it was edited but was still a bit too Western. Please, edit it further so that it loses that Western bias too.
No edit on Wikipedia is ever final. That's the whole point of this process.
On a purely intellectual level, it would be great if we could all work together and edit this over and over to edit each other's biases out of the list. What would an ultimate final unbiased list of NPOV articles look like? I'd love to know. 
It's also a good Wikipedian selling point. No paper-based encyclopeadia (e.g Britannica) can come close to offering anything similar, as we're exploiting an internationalism they can't really duplicate. Why merely emulate paper-based encyclopeadias when we can potentially exceed them?
We will disagree. That is not a problem in itself and we shouldn't automatically divide and go our separate ways at the first sign of a disagreement. Let us divine out of the confusion what we can agree on. Let us edit it and alter it and change the wording or whatever is necessary to make it fit.
Our disagreement is what keeps us honest. We shouldn't be frightened of that but should be celebrating it. If I add Eurocentricism to the list then come here and tell me where I went wrong and we'll edit it back out of the list. We can work to keep each other honest and that step-by-step takes the biases out of the list one-by-one.
Please also can we not be divisive and suggest that ""Western culture"" is to blame. I've had to pick up on a discrimination point about women (which I believe had an American origin) and argued about sexual discrimination (with, if I understand the reference he made correctly, has Israeli origin). Westerners are equally picking up biases that other Westerners are introducing too. 
We're all biased. We can't help that. But - how shall we put it? - Wikipedians by their nature of contributing to this project aren't necessarily representatives of the wilder internationally negative policies of their governments. Have I put that diplomatically enough for everyone? It's very likely many of us are here to learn about things we don't know (seems logically enough for an encyclopeadia, yes?), such as about other cultures, to help correct and rectify our ignorance. The whole point of knowledge and education is to correct the problem of ignorance in some way.
As one of my fellow countrymen, the founder of Britain's National Health Service, Aneurin Bevan, once said: ""This is my truth, tell me yours""."

Words that are searched for the most frequently (and over multiple languages, if possible, to diffuse language bias), should be made highest priority for inclusion in new wikipedias.  Is it possible to obtain these statistics?

I'd resist making it solely based on searches alone because the fact that no-one has recently searched for differential calculus or Plato doesn't mean that the subjects aren't important or that they won't see a lot of searches made on them in the future. 
For example, Iraq or George Bush might get a lot of searches at the moment because of contemporary events (people looking to better inform themselves over the issues in that day's news stories). 
Being based on searches alone might bias things to contemporary events more than it should. This is an encyclopeadia rather than a news service, after all (though, yes, one of the advantages of Wikipedia is that it can update incredibly quickly to not necessarily be that distant to a news service but it isn't the prime purpose here).
But a list of searches could help prioritise and, on a purely practical level, search terms might show up topics that we never thought of. It might help expose holes and biases in the list. You never know."

Just because the list originated there doesn't mean providing links to every page there is helpful: people will follow the links wanting to find basic info on each person linked to so they'll have a resource to draw from for various foreign-language Wikis and an understanding of what the topic is about. As such, why not just link to En-Wiki, which, being by far the most populated and active Wiki, has articles for every topic listed, and often very comprehensive ones. It just seems like the most practical thing to do. What do y'all think? -

You don't do something this major and turn the whole thing upside down by yourself with no second opinion whatsoever; this is a collaborative effort, not a one man show.

I came here to help, to move the article forward, and to build consensus, not to try to force the article to go my way with unilateral actions. Your kneejerk assumption that I'm just here to make push my agenda and my post here was merely a ""formality"", just because I made major edits (that happen to all be improvements) to the article, is, to put it mildly, premature. I started making my edits before anyone had responded on the talk page for three reasons: (1) because editing the article itself is the best way to get other editor's attention (a very valuable thing considering that this is not an especially active project page), which is why I directed interested editors to this Talk page in my edit summaries (yet you arbitrarily claimed I thought ""noone would object or notice"" anyway); (2) to give a clear demonstration of what a lot of the changes I have in mind will look like if implemented, knowing they can be reverted if necessary but that putting such a version up will give people a much better idea of the options available; and (3) because I've made equally major edits many times in the past to this very list, and never has anyone objected to a single one, so I had no reason to assume there'd be a huge upswelling of bile at this particular edit.
So, there's just one key problem with your response: you haven't actually said anything that's actually wrong with any of the changes I made. Your sole objection thus far is that I didn't wait long enough before making the changes, which is a bureaucratic objection, not a content-related one. As such, I'd greatly appreciate it if, rather than shrilly denouncing me for not waiting a few months for the proper bureaucratic channels to allow me to quickly and easily show what page changes I have in mind, you actually explained why you think so many of the recent edits I made ""violate several agreed-upon compromises here"", and, much more importantly, why they're bad for this page. Wikis allow reverts; there's no need for such tedious, counterproductive formality, when simply boldly making the changes facilitates debate and discussion much better. I've now shown some of the edits I have in mind, and you've now said you have an objection to them, so we can begin: Let's discuss this, not lobby accusations at one another. What about my changes is detrimental or harmful, rather than productive and valuable? I'd love nothing more than some thought-out criticism. -"

In the long run it may not matter, because I've noticed that most of the wikis that have adopted this list into their own languages as a starting point, have ended up with vastly different looking lists, sometimes linking to en, sometimes to simple, sometimes to a mixture of the two, but rest assured, they generally will make the 'list of articles all languages should have' look the way they think it ought to look, and not at all the way it looks here.

I understand the reaction. Everyone feels a degree of involuntary possessiveness and conservatism with regards to articles they've spent a lot of time working on.
""but I would like to see at least a couple of other voices weigh in,"" - So would I. And I think the best way to get a lot of people's opinions on all these changes is to put them on the main page so users will realize something's happening and come to the Talk page to voice their opinion. If you prefer, we can wait until at least a few more supporters manifest on the Talk page before restoring my edits, but I just think it's faster in the long run to leave the heavily-revised up on the main page, even if we end up not using any of my changes in the end.
""particularly the big change here that I feel needs approval is the redirecting from simple to main en:"" - Fair enough, but realize that that's the easiest change to revert of them all: a simple mass-replace (which any text editor can perform) of ""[[en:"" with ""[[simple:"" will instantly restore the original links—that's how I changed all the links to linking to the English Wikipedia, in fact. So, if the only change I made that you object to at this point is the ""[[simple:"" -> ""[[en:"" change, why not restore my previous edit, if only so I can continue working on other aspects of the list in the meantime (I've been continuing to work on my changes, reorganizations, copyediting, link-checking, etc. while waiting, and will gladly upload them as soon as it's OK).
""I realise a lot of the articles are missing from simple,"" - That's an understatement. Most of the articles are missing from simple (whereas all but one or two of the articles on the entire list are on the English Wikipedia), and even the ones that are there are usually very small (often one or two sentences) and in mediocre or poor English. (This is not meant to be an insult, it is just an honest assessment of the vast majority of Simple English articles I've read, of which there are a few hundred.) Simple English may certainly someday be a viable source for concise, well-written articles on all the subjects listed in ""List of articles all languages should have"", but at this time, purely realistically and practically speaking, English Wikipedia is a much better utility to link to. It's in the same language, but it has many more articles, much more content in those articles (but the lead sections of most of those articles should serve the same ""summarizing"" purpose as Simple English articles, and should be equally clear and understandable), and a vastly larger body of editors to check that content and ensure that it is verifiable, NPOV, consistent, and well-written.
""but I can tell you the people I've met there who do contribute do take a lot of pride in their effort at what is sometimes a difficult task, much like walking a tightrope..."" - I understand the difficulty, respect the editors for their dedication, and appreciate the effort they've put into creating and improving so many articles, but they do have the list at ""Simple English"" already, right? Why not use that one to link to Simple English's articles, and for this one, which is much more expanded and thus much more difficult to meet the requirements of with Simple English's (relatively) minimal resources, use English Wikipedia?
""And I still don't think trying to force every culture and all languages to ""be on the same page"" is ever a good thing, so I'm actually glad that all the lists look different."" - Sure. Though it does make the title of this page misleading, no? :) -"

Why is ""homosexuality"" an unimportant or off-limits topic? I added both homosexuality and heterosexuality to the list of topics, along with asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, sex, sexual intercourse, male, female, etc.—all vitally important topics that were missing from the list. Why do you object to ""homosexuality"", but not ""heterosexuality"" or any of the others I added? And I saw no valid arguments against including it in any of the above discussions; could you repeat or quote the argument you are referring to? Homosexuality is not an issue in just one country or other; it is a matter of worldwide importance, biologically (it's not like humans are the only ones to engage in homosexual behavior), socially, historically, ethically, and politically, and for both those who approve of it and those who oppose it. Censoring the inclusion of a homosexuality article on the list just because it's controversial is deeply biased and itself seems specifically targeted to promoting an agenda (by suppressing information on a highly noteworthy encyclopedic topic just because some find it distasteful): the fact that it's controversial makes it more noteworthy and important to include in any general-use encyclopedia, regardless of language—and as you said, this list is a guideline, not absolute law, so any Wikipedia that prefers not to include such an article can do so! Not including an article on homosexuality would be like not including an article on ""evolution"" on this list just because it's controversial or offensive to certain people. That's not an ""agenda"", anymore than listing articles on abortion, The Holocaust, or God is ""promoting an agenda""; any good encyclopedia article will include all noteworthy information on the relevant topic, both positive and negative. Plus ""sexuality"" is too vague a topic; most encyclopedias, including the English Wikipedia, don't even have an article on ""sexuality""—you might be thinking of sexual orientation if you're looking for an umbrella-article for this topic, though I honestly don't see the need.

There should be nothing like this page drawn up to look all official, dictating that all languages must write an article about homosexuality.

I am not so unreasonable that I am unwilling to be convinced on this, or any other, issue, provided that you support it with something more than your personal opinion. I can certainly support everything I said, if you dispute a word of it.
""Your pov is showing here..."" - An incorrect statement, and one that, ironically, applies to you instead of myself. I have not expressed anything regarding my own POVs on the matter; indeed, I have no strong leanings one way or the other on this issue, though there are certainly other, unrelated issues regarding which I hold a bias. All I have said is that homosexuality is a noteworthy topic, which it is; I don't have to have an ""agenda"" to hold that homosexuality is an important topic for an encyclopedia anymore than I have to be a Nazi or Zionist to hold that ""The Holocaust"" is important, or a pregnant woman or religious fundamentalist to hold that ""abortion"" is important, or a soldier or pacifist to hold that ""war"" is important, or a mathematician to hold that ""mathematics"" is important; all of these are just as clearly significant and necessary as ""homosexuality"", and bias one way or the other has nothing to do with it. Your own POV, on the other hand, is very clearly being shown by the fact that you are explicitly justifying the exclusion of a ""homosexuality"" article from the list on the grounds that you believe, based on your own personal biases, that it is a ""deviancy"" (even though plenty of other ""deviancies"" are already included on the list!), and that if a certain culture has no tolerance for homosexuality, we cannot suggest (you repeatedly argue that including that article on this list would be ""shoving it down their throats"", when we had mere lines above already very clearly demonstrated that the entirety of this list is suggestions and ideas, not requirements!) that an article be written to cover the topic. Although I have until this point at least found your POVs reasonable, even where I disagreed with them, on this issue I'm afraid that your bigotry has completely clouded your better judgment. There is no consensus to ban ""homosexuality"" from this list, and no possible reasonable justification for such a ban. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, which means that it deals solely in information—it is not a tool for trying to force one's morality upon others by restricting articles to ""clean"", ""safe"", or ""uncontroversial"" topics, which is excactly what you are (very inconsistently) trying to do here by banning homosexuality not on the basis that it's not important (which is the only requirement for inclusion on the list!), but on the basis that it's evil or that certain cultures believe it to be. On those grounds, if Nazi Germany was still in power it would be unacceptable of us to list ""Judaism"" on the main page, because that would be offensive to people who consider Jews immoral or deviants; that level of cultural relativism isn't so much tolerant of others' views as it is oppressive and intolerant, to the point of censorship. You'll need a damned good argument and a hell of a strong consensus to violate common sense and every Wikipedia's standards so drastically.
""and I object that it should be categorised as something ""biological""."" - If you think homosexuality is important because of its social and political implications (which is certainly a strong aspect of its significance in today's world), then add it to the ""Human/Social issues"" section instead of the ""Sex"" one; excluding it altogether, however, is clearly unacceptable and an endorsement by Wikipedia of bigotry. I truly don't see any basis for your claim that homosexuality isn't biological, however (even if it's not only biological, by the definition you happen to be using), and even if it was, that wouldn't make it any less noteworthy or relevant to the list—that's just another aspect of the ""controversy"" that any source of neutral and verifiable information, like Wikipedia, must not ignore.
""dictating that all languages must write an article about homosexuality."" - Nothing on this list dictates anything, or says anything about what languages must do. You are constructing a very flimsy strawman, conveniently ignoring the conversation on this exact topic that we'd had mere minutes before. Nothing on this list is an absolute requirement, so why are you suddenly forgeting that obvious fact? Either you've somehow forgotten that fact or you're just being blatantly deceitful with your rhetoric at this point; either way, it's time to stop.
""Leave things like that optional for each wiki,"" - It's already optional. Everything on this list is optional.
""and don't try to destroy them"" - You'll have to back up this outrageous accusation if it's to be interpreted as anything other than a personal attack (and more unsupported rhetoric). That, or apologize.
""if you wish for the whole project to be taken seriously."" - Listing ""homosexuality"" on a very lengthy page of all highly noteworthy topics for an encyclopedia to cover will make the project not ""be taken seriously""? That's funny. In reality, the exact opposite is the truth. You're making a mockery of the list by trying to force your POV down the throats of the entire Wikipedia project: because you personally find homosexuality immoral, you find it unacceptable to write about this topic, even though there's just about unanimous agreement among Wikipedia's editors that it's highly noteworthy! This project is not just a way for you to try to push an agenda on others, as you should surely be aware of by now; if you want to argue that homosexuality (or anything else, for that matter!) isn't globally noteworthy or encyclopedic because of its morality, start a new Wikimedia or Wikipedia proposal to that effect, and I'll gladly discuss this there. (Though it will surely be shot down, just like every other attempt in the past to institute a moral code on Wikipedia projects, every single one of which has failed in the past.) Don't try to sneak this subtle homophobia into a totally unrelated page simply because it's what you believe; that's just dishonest and manipulative. Sorry to have to say it, but it's the truth: only one of us is trying to use this page to force a POV on Wikipedia regarding the ""homosexuality"" topic, and that person is you.
""Also, you speak about ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" like they are somehow on an equal par or something"" - They are—on Wikipedia, even if nothing else. For Wikipedia's purposes, they are no more or less equal than ""right"" or ""left"", ""black"" or ""white""; they are two aspects of a sexual dichotomy, and nothing more or less. Whether one is ""good"" or the other is ""bad"" is not for Wikipedia to decide; that's just one of many subjects which articles on those two sexual orientations can cover, along with health risks, history, terminology, political and religious controversy, etc. ""Evil"" topics and ""good"" ones are covered exactly equally on Wikipedia; it is never justifiable to attempt to restrict coverage on a noteworthy topic based solely on whether the subject of that topic is good or bad. I challenge you to present any policy on a Wikipedia of any language that forbids writing about homosexuality; until you can do so, you have absolutely no right to try to interject your anti-homosexual POV onto this general-usage page, no matter how strong your convictions on this matter are. Save it for your user page. This project is a list of important topics, not a list of socially acceptable/ethical/uncontroversial topics. In fact, in many cases, the more controversial or ""immoral"" something is, the more significant and noteworthy it is, making it more likely to appear on this page than something that almost nobody has any strong opinions about (like the ethics of cottage cheese). 
By the way, this addition is infinitely less controversial and unusual than Blockinbox seems so strongly to think it is. There are already homosexuality articles (many of them quite detailed and lengthy) on every single one of the most widely-used Wikipedias in existence; out of the 25 Wikipedias that have the largest number of articles, only a single one (one of the lower ones, #19) lacks an article on homosexuality (or just hasn't bothered to put interwiki tags on the page in question). In fact, the only thing that seems to determine whether or not homosexuality is covered in a certain language's Wikipedia, that I can ascertain, is how many articles that Wikipedia has—the fewer articles a Wikipedia has, the less likely it is to have an article on homosexuality (and the less likely it is to have an article on any other specific topic, quite naturally!), which is quite understandable: the fewer articles and editors a Wikipedia has, the less likely it is that they've gotten around to creating pages for specific sexual orientations, or for hundreds and hundreds of other items that are on the ""List of articles all languages should have"". Homosexuality gets much better use on foreign-language Wikipedias than most of the things on the ""List of articles all languages should have"", though!! I can provide you with a complete list (in order of number of total articles) of which Wikipedias do and don't have articles on homosexuality, if you'd like; I wrote one up while researching to see if any of your claims have a basis in fact (as far as I've been able to ascertain, they don't), and can easily share it if you think it would be valuable for discerning a bias or variance in coverage.
Until you can back up some of your claims, however, I'm afraid that it's simply unacceptable to leave your version of the page on ""List of articles all languages should have""; you are the one on whom the burden of proof will lie to demonstrate that homosexuality is considered unacceptable to write about on a significant number of the foreign-language Wikipedias, since you are the only one making such a dramatic and bold statement. Just because my version of the page is newer doesn't make it more controversial—the view that homosexuality is a ""deviancy"", despite being a common view, is infinitely more controversial than the view that homosexuality is a significant issue (which is all this page is concerned with), which the vast majority of people on both sides of this controversy can agree on, if nothing else. -"

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	1	Why link to missing articles and stubs on Simple rather than complete articles on En-W?	12	Silence	20:49, 29 March 2006 (UTC)	"""you continue to say that homosexuality is of major significance to every culture in the world."" - That's a misunderstanding and distortion at best. I never said that homosexuality is significant purely on a cultural level; it's more important on a social, religious, and political level (though certainly there is a cultural aspect to it). More importantly, you seem to hold the deeply mistaken view that different language Wikipedias are supposed to be biased towards different cultures. This is not the case: the only reason different Wikipedias exist at all is because not everyone speaks any one language, and thus information must be translated into a variety of languages to reach a wider audience. If it was possible (and it's obviously not), there would be no difference between any of the foreign-language Wikipedias; every Wikipedia, regardless of language, would have the exact same content, just written in a different tongue. Since that is not possible, obviously cultural bias will affect every Wikipedia, but our objective is not to go out of a way to succumb to our respective biases and let them fester while ignoring all contrary views, but rather to explain each culture's view within encyclopedia articles. That's what the NPOV policy is for. The Swedish Wikipedia, the Arabic Wikipedia, the English Wikipedia, and every other language's Wikipedia should all be trying equally hard to counter their respective cultural biases with outside perspectives. Every language of Wikipedia should, ideally, at some point deal with every significant perspective, including ones from outside the culture of the speakers of that language. This is the only way to avoid systemic bias and to make Wikipedia an encyclopedia of human knowledge and information, not a moral code or tool for censorship. If there is controversy over whether homosexuality is a sin or not, it is every Wikipedia's job to report on that controversy, not to participate in it and try to endorse one view or the other by suppressing or forbidding an article on the issue, regardless of the majority view on homosexuality within a certain country (and Wikipedia's are divided on a linguistic, not nationalistic, basis anyway). That's what encyclopedias, and reference tools in general, in every culture, do: they provide well-referenced, unbiased information (or as close to it as possible) on all subjects, controversial and uncontroversial, and try to minimize, not exacerbate, their natural biases. Obviously it's not always easy to overcome cultural bias, but that's an ongoing struggle on every Wikipedia—cultural bias is not something that should be encouraged, as that only leads to the suppression of highly noteworthy and commonplace alternative views, which would transform Wikipedia from an encyclopedic resource into nothing but a tool for propaganda. All of this applies to the English Wikipedia just as much as the others, of course.
""I say it is not."" - You've already established that. The difference is, I have (and can, if you ask me to back up any of my statements) supported all of my statements with reasoning and evidence, whereas all you've done are repeatedly state your POV, without any justification or support, and expected that to hold sway. I'm getting rather bored of this discussion's one-sidedness.
""you speak like you have some kind of authority on the subject"" - No, I don't. I speak like someone who's familiar with the subject, and can thus explain it to you, since you obviously deeply misunderstand Wikipedia policy on this issue.
""saying that for wikipedia purposes, homosexuality is equal to heterosexuality like right and left."" - It is. For Wikipedia purposes, no article's subject is good or evil; no article on Wikipedia should ever state ""X is wrong"" or ""Y is immoral"" or ""Z is good""; it should only provide, with proper sourcing, claims and statements of such things, and who has claimed and stated them. Wikipedia itself does not have an opinion about any political issue; it merely reports on the controversy, without weighing in on it. Ergo, Wikipedia has no more favoritism for ""heterosexuality"" over ""homosexuality"" than it does for ""right-handed"" over ""left-handed"", even though most humans are heterosexual and most are right-handed, and even though historically many cultures have discriminated against both homosexual people and left-handed people. Even if homosexuality is immoral (which is unlikely, but not impossible—very little is genuinely impossible), it is not Wikipedia's place to say so (nor is it Wikipedia's place to act like this noteworthy issue does not exist by not even writing about it in an article), only to report on noteworthy sources that have said so.
""How did you get to make up this rule for wikipedia?"" - I didn't. I just have a passing familiarity with the rules, standards, and principles that already exist on Wikipedia, and indeed exist in all general-use encyclopedic references. You would do well to review Wikipedia's official policies, including Neutral point of view, and to become acquainted with Wikipedia's numerous and ongoing attempts to combat systemic cultural bias. If anything, you're the one who needs to provide a policy supporting your claims that it's acceptable to ban ""homosexuality"" from this list, since you're the one making the new claim to this effect. If a policy supporting your view does not currently exist, you will have to propose one and seek to get it passed; until one is created permitting your censorship of homosexuality-related topics, you cannot implement your personal beliefs on this unrelated page.
""That is something for each individual wikipedia to decide independently by consensus among the speakers of that language, and many are going to object strongly to the notion of some unseen, central bureau in unknowmn location, dictating that it ""must"" write about distasteful topics that it does not deem necessary."" - Nope, but more will object to some arbitrary, deeply biased individual randomly deciding that ""homosexuality"" isn't an important topic just because he finds it distasteful. You are not God; you cannot dictate what topics are or are not ""distasteful"". That is to be left to the individual articles to decide; the only purpose of this list is to provide a listing of highly noteworthy and significant topics, not to judge whether some of those topics are or aren't culturally acceptable. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an arbiter of morality, and you are profoundly overstepping your bounds to judge that ""homosexuality"" is an unacceptably offensive topic, and nothing else on the list is—to censor certain topics on this list is not only problematic because it leads to biased and uneven coverage of noteworthy information, but also because it implicitly suggests that Wikipedia approves of every other article listed! In other words, your actions are making it seem that Wikipedia approves of genocide, rape, and slavery, but disapproves of homosexuality. Clearly this is not an acceptable state of affairs. If you want to create a list of ""uncontroversial"" articles, that's a completely different matter, and you should make a separate page for that. You should not try to infect this list with your personal biases, especially when they're biases against certain topics rather than for them (the latter being much less harmful and destructive in the long run).
Incidentally, you continue to repeatedly claim that a number of foreign-language Wikipedias are going to object to including any information whatsoever on ""homosexuality"", but you have utterly failed to provide any support whatsoever for this claim. In reality there's no Wikipedia in existence that has expressed any problem with having an article on ""homosexuality""—if there is one, on any language, please feel free to share it with us. Until then, your claims are entirely baseless, and just reflect your own strongly-felt POVs on the matter: because you consider homosexuality a ""deviancy"" and ""distasteful"", you think everyone else should, even on a neutral and academic resource like Wikipedia. This is fundamentally unacceptable and bigoted. Wikipedia does not judge morality: it reports on information. Silence can speak louder than words, and excluding noteworthy topics entirely because a certain editor disapproves of them is even worse than including ones that aren't quite noteworthy enough.
""The software should not be used as a vehicle for what you are trying to push."" - And what am I trying to push? You have repeatedly insinuated that just because I disagree with you about what topics are noteworthy enough to include on the list, and that just because I don't believe this list should be used to try to judge which topics are ""moral"" and which are ""immoral"", I am somehow trying to advance an ""agenda"" or am just following my own ""POV"" or am trying to ""push"" my views down people's throats; all of these are very clearly false claims, and you still owe me a number of apologies for making such unsupported personal attacks and accusations, veiled though some of them may be. I am here to improve the list's usefulness to editors, not to push any POV. The problem here is that you are more concerned with pushing your POV than with what's in the best interests of Wikipedia and this list, and you assume that just because I am not willing to let you use this list as a vehicle for your homophobia, I am ""trying to push"" a belief on others. The opposite is the case; I'm removing another user's bias, not adding my own. Trust me, if I was going to add articles to this list based on my own personal interests and POV, I'd be adding very different entries than the ones I currently am; I'm honestly not remotely interested in this silly controversy. :) I'm just not so blind that I'm incapable of realizing that the issue exists and is noteworthy.
""I am not required to prove anything to you."" - Of course you are, if you want any of your claims to be evaluated based on their truth-value reasonability, rather than purely on their rhetorical tactics. If you fail to provide any support for your claims, beliefs, biases and accusations, they are only words, and we cannot assume that they are correct just because you believe in them strongly. I've provided plenty of support for my reasoning (and will gladly provide more if you dispute anything at all I've said); why are you so unwiling (unable?) to do the same?
""In many countries it is illegal to promote homosexual behaviour,"" - How is that relevant? That's just another important fact that every comprehensive Wikipedia should include in their ""homosexuality"" articles. On Wikipedia, articles do not exist to promote or support the thing that is being written about; they only exist to provide neutral, factual, cited information on that thing.
""that is a fact you can easily find out,"" - It's a fact I already knew, and is one of the many reasons I added ""homosexuality"" to the list. The fact that a topic is unpleasant or controversial does not make it less noteworthy, and noteworthiness and significance are the only things that determine what is included on this list. If it wasn't, we wouldn't have Adolf Hitler included on the list either, but Hitler is obviously noteworthy, despite expression of Nazism being important in some countries, like Germany.
""the subject is similar to bestiality"" - Correct. If bestiality was a more noteworthy and immediate, current issue in so many parts of the world today, it would be included on the list too. Since it's less noteworthy, it's not included, and rightly so; the list is an analysis of the most significant encyclopedic articles to write about, not a judgment of the most pleasant, good, righteous, lawful, or moral topics to write about.
""and if you want to write about it in your language do so."" - If I want to write about it in any article, there is no policy against my doing so. The same applies to any noteworthy topic on any subject. Wikipedia's various languages are (at least in principle) divided solely on a linguistic level. The only difference between the English Wikipedia, the Chinese Wikipedia, and the Finnish Wikipedia is the language they are written in; every single one should, ideally, have all noteworthy perspectives on the subject matter in question, regardless of what language or country they were originally written in. Wikipedia is not a tool for propaganda or censorship, in this or any other language, and that's never going to change. Sorry for the bad news.
""Do not force your sicknesses on every people ND in the world,"" - What ""sickness"" are you talking about? The sickness of encyclopedic, neutral coverage of topics? If you continue to make acidic personal attacks and insinuations on my character, motivation, and personal life, I will be forced to . This is your only warning; please remain civil in this discussion. Or at the very least provide evidence and reasoning, not rhetoric and jabs, to support your claims; at least that would progress the discussion, rather than try to drag it down into a battle.
""I will continue to expose and resist your sick scheme tooth and nail by any means possible for me, if this is what you have set in your mind that your purpose is to recruit deviant and sick, sinful and backward  behaviours to all the peoples and languages of the world."" - As I said, this is your final warning. I have no interest in exchanging personal attacks with you. I am here to improve the utility and value of this list. If you have a problem with maintaining a basic level of tolerance or understanding of your fellow human beings, that's your own personal issue, and you should use a personal website to promote that view, not Wikipedia. Please remain civil in your comments, and stop sabotaging and warping the project you've spent so much time in the past improving. -"

Unless you have anything more valuable to contribute to this page besides bigotry and empty rhetoric, you should stop wasting the time of editors who are genuinely concerned with improving this list of articles. Wikipedia does not promote the various views it discusses - Wikipedia certainly does not promote, say, drug overdose, but that doesn't mean that it can't talk about John Belushi's death, or any other topic relating to drug overdose. If drug overdose were not a uniformly-negative subject, then talking about any positive aspects of it would also not be promoting it. Wikipedia aspires to a Neutral Point of View on all subjects, and the majority of editors regularly attempt to bring that quality to every article. People who attempt to stop that are violating Wiki policy and undermining the whole project.

I've removed heterosexuality and homosexuality from ""reproduction"" and placed ""sexuality"" in the ""social issues"" section.

Note I do so for NPOV, acceptable compromise and factual accuracy, not moral judgement (see ""inclusion of homosexuality"" discussion above).

Sexuality as a whole is a separate social issue, related but essentially independent of the mechanics of sexual reproduction.

After all, it could be deemed as equally prejudical to leave out bisexuality, non-sexuality (rare but possible: Those who lack any sexual urges completely), celebacy (of religious and non-religious types), no sex before marriage and the like. 

Positive discrimination is still discrimination and violates NPOV from the other direction of showing favouritism instead of prejudice. Both are NPOV violations.

Also, this compromise was reached by consensus (because if subcategories of ""sexuality"" are left to the individual Wikipedias then where it is an illegal offence to promote homosexuality, the article can be left out to avoid breaking the law). One shouldn't really have unilaterally changed it without consultation. *cough*"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	1	Why link to missing articles and stubs on Simple rather than complete articles on En-W?	17	PetrochemicalPete	14:32, 24 April 2006 (UTC)	"On the other matter of unilateral changes: There's nothing inherently wrong in this. ""Be bold"" is the Wikipedia motto.

The issue was merely one of courtesy. People have worked on the list for months. Debates have raged over the inclusion of one thing or the exclusion of another. Compromises have been bashed out.

It is a social ""faux pas"" not to have shown courtesy to others by acknowledging and respecting their work. It is an editing ""faux pas"" to assert a unilateral list over a multilateral one; You unintentionally re-ignite all the contravertial issues all over again. Pragmatically, you undo do a lot of hard work and, if compromises need to be debated again, you introduce unnecessary duplication of work.

Wikipedia is a collabrative effort; Please - everyone - respect that fact and respect the work and efforts of others. This applies as equally in both directions. Major unilateral change without consultation can appear to be a form of vandalism to other people's prior efforts (and comes across as rude, whether intentional or not). But, at the same time, Wikipedia is a collabrative effort of constant revision that ""no edit is final nor sacred"".

Disagreements keep us honest and accurate. Embrace them and learn from them."

Religion - there are severals articles in major religions informing about their doctrines. However, the list lacks divisions!
For instance, there is no at least :simple:Catholicism, :simple:Protestantism nor :simple:Orthodox church on the list!
The same refers to Shia and Sunni...
In my opinion these articles should be included.
Mathematicians: the list lacks of at least a couple of truly great names like Augustin Cauchy (one of the founders of mathematical analysis), A.N. Kolmogorov (axiomatic probability) or Stefan Banach (functional analysis). I know the list should be possibly lean (and overall - it _isn't_) but I think these people are far more important for overall humanity than pretty locacl games of, say, :simple:Mancala or :simple:Waterpolo.
 Langugages - the list is quite long but I would consider submitting :simple:Italian (as a child langauge of Latin, quite widely spoken) and :simple:Polish (second Slavic and the biggest western Slavic language with a quite big diaspora all over the world) and maybe Portugal (Portugal - and Brasil). I would perceive the fact of the considerably large Wikipedias written in these languages as some additional incentive and evdence to put these languages on the list.

Greetings, and thanks for the discussion."
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	3	 What stays, what goes? 	0	Silence	02:56, 30 March 2006 (UTC)	"I propose that we establish a consistent system for discussing and verifying the inclusion of entries in this list. There are many items on this list that clearly don't belong there, many that clearly do belong there, and many that are in a grey-zone where we will need to talk about the reasons why and why not to have such an article included. The current list is, by and large, haphazard and arbitrary, with inconsistent coverage that demonstrates bias both by culture and by field of knowledge; it is ruled by the whims of whoever happens to edit it on each day, with no real method of determining what stays and what goes beyond each individual user's personal conception of the relative ""importance"" of all these articles. As long as this situation continues, this page will be of minimal use to the many Wikipedias. The first step in tightening and bulking up this page should be to figure out a way to address the hundreds and hundreds of articles on this list which may have their importance disputed.

Although I welcome any suggestions for how best to pursue this goal (or any other comments whatsoever), if some specific ideas are what you're looking for, I propose, first of all, that we create a ""removed"" list for storing all the entries whose importance has not been established. (A similar practice has been instituted, highly successfully, on several lengthy (and prone to continuous expansion) lists on Wikipedia. Perhaps have it at Talk:List of articles all languages should have/Removed?) This will encourage users to discuss and justify both removals and additions, will keep former staples of the list that are later deemed not significant enough from being lost and forgotten entirely, and will make the list in general easier to deal with by not crushing us with the weight of quasi-noteworthy entries. Second, we should go through each section of this page, one at a time, and discuss (and possibly vote on, if there's any support for that) the various entries of each and whether there are any important missing topics, or any topics that should be removed. This will make the page less fluid and more stable, and thus a more reliable resource, at least for ascertaining what most editors think the most necessary articles are.

Once that's out of the way and we've made quite a few removals and additions, we can start discussing ways to make the individual entries more useful to our readers, such as by adding one-sentence descriptions of each article (which will also help establish why each entry provided is noteworthy, which is currently very unclear to anyone reading this list, though the new links to the English Wikipedia help that greatly), grading entries on a 1-3 scale of importance (e.g., ""1"" for articles like ""language"", ""2"" for articles like ""grammar"", and ""3"" for articles like ""english language"", in decreasing order of centrality), and/or list various translations of the entries in the most common languages of Wikipedias—there are many interesting possibilities to discuss in the future, but we can't begin to really delve into and debate how to expand this page's format until we've gone over the specific entries in enough depth to confirm their reliable status (so we don't end up wasting too much more time by saving the reworking of the list's entries until after they've been expanded) as ""articles all languages should have"", to at least establish a stable position to start from. -"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	3	 What stays, what goes? 	1	Amgine	03:10, 30 March 2006 (UTC)	" My personal opinion: Do not plan to have a single list of articles all languages should have; instead, have two lists. The first list should be the 1000 articles which all languages should have. The second should contain 4000 - 9000 additional articles which are in addition to the top 1000.

 Criteria for the top 1000 will be varied, and disputed. Wikipedias are not primarily used for research, but for answering questions. For this reason, usefulness and popularity of an article are of greater importance than historic or effectual value. George W. Bush is a more important figure than George Washington of Mount Vernon in this scale, to use a US-centric example.

 Criteria for the additional articles may be somewhat looser; there is more room, so pick the top number of entries and stop worrying about inclusion/exclusion until that number has been reached. At that time, budget the number of entries by field, and allow persons focused on those fields to determine relative importance (again, I would stress usefulness over academic value; birth control in humans is not as useful ascondom.) - Amgine / talk"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	3	 What stays, what goes? 	2	Silence	03:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)	"Your suggestion about having two lists seems extremely reasonable to me. It is, in fact, one of the ways I'd imagined possibly implementing the ""1-3"" system I specified above: 1-2 would be listed on a single, compact page, while 3 (i.e. the more borderline entries, still very important but not quite as ""vital"") would be listed in a much more expansive version. Or something like that, anyway. The only thing I disagree on is the exact numbers you suggested we make the lists adhere to; I don't see the value of forcing the list to adhere to an artificial, set number of articles just because it seems more orderly. Each list should be exactly as long as it merited by the number of topics that meet that page's standards of importance, be that 500 articles or 5,000. We should worry about being consistent in how we apply our standards to each page, not about how many entries are on each page total (at least not in a specific way; if either page gets bloated in a general sense (e.g., having 10,000 entries instead of 1,000 would be a big problem, but having 1,400 would not) that's indeed an issue). But, yes, I think that would indeed be the most organized, and valuable, way to deal with this project: an ideal mix of inclusivity and strictness of standards.
""For this reason, usefulness and popularity of an article are of greater importance than historic or effectual value."" - I'm not sure I understand, perhaps because I tend to mean the same thing when I say ""useful"" and ""valuable""; if something's valuable, how could it be useless to our readers? I think I agree in principle, though, if what you're saying is that we should concern ourselves with the practical issue of giving our readers basic knowledge on the most essential topics, rather than with more esoteric concerns such as qualifying whether this topic or that one is more objectively important. Perhaps if you clarified what you mean a bit, I'd be more sure that I agree with what you're saying.
""Wikipedias are not primarily used for research, but for answering questions."" - Perhaps, but Wikipedias are still encyclopedias, not FAQs.
""George W. Bush is a more important figure than George Washington of Mount Vernon in this scale, to use a US-centric example."" - I only half-agree. Though I honestly wouldn't be especially averse to seeing a list that includes G. Bush and not G. Washington (and I'd certainly place both Bush and Washington much higher on the scale of relevance to this list than other ""founding father"" American history staples like Franklin, Jefferson and Adams), I think we should, at least to some extent, minimize the natural tendency of editors to be biased towards modern events vs. historical ones. Though the utilitarian model does, in general, prefer current situations to past ones, and I don't object to this being implemented on some level, to distinguish Washington and Bush to such an extreme level that Bush is definitely kept and Washington definitely excluded seems to be overdoing it: temporal bias is already a bad problem on most Wikipedias, and we shouldn't worsen it by excessively favoring recent history over earlier history). Part of the reason for having a list like this is to remind people of important articles they might forget to make, which means that sticking entirely to the articles that are already the most popular and commonplace ones on every Wikipedia rather defeats the purpose of this project. Overall, I think we should strike a balance between appealing solely to the most popular, modern topics, and being completely apathetic to whether something happened yesterday (9/11) or 2000 years ago (the burning of Rome); the latter's just plain unrealistic and unhelpful, but the former's rather too short-sighted and will cause this list to change rapidly with new trends and current events, which is harmful as well and will undermine the stability and reliability of the listings. (For example, one issue is: will we update the list with the new U.S. president every single time one comes into office? Though Bush is noteworthy enough to be indisputably necessary on this list, not every future president will necessarily be the same, despite the U.S.'s current central importance in world politics.)
""so pick the top number of entries and stop worrying about inclusion/exclusion until that number has been reached."" - I'll have to disagree with you here again. Such a method would just cause the list to be deeply biased towards whichever things the first editors to work on that list are most interested in, and biased against any later editors' additions. We should apply the same standards to a certain article that's been suggested for inclusion, regardless of whether we currently have 12 or 3,500 articles out of a 3,500 maximum. Important is important. This is also one of the reasons I don't like the idea of an arbitrary, set limit of articles to either list: it will inevitably either lead to bloat (as people add relatively trivial entries just to fill up space), favoritism and exclusion of some topics in favor of others (as newly-suggested entries aren't added simply because there are already too many entries in the list), or, most likely, both. If we're diligent in applying standards of importance to every article that's added to both lists, it won't matter exactly how large—or how small—either one gets.
""At that time, budget the number of entries by field,"" - This also seems like a very bad idea to me (unless I'm misinterpreting what you mean by ""budget by field""). What if there just happen to be more much-needed entries in ""biography"" than in ""mathematics"", in ""geography"" than in ""history"", or in ""biology"" than in ""chemistry""? Why set arbitrary maximums or minimums on lists, when we can't be certain ahead of time what the ideal number for any section or field will be? It's just a simple fact that some fields of human knowledge have more vitally-important distinct articles to be written about than others; we should have more distinct articles from the field of anatomy, for example, than from the field of psychology, even though both are very important fields—not because anatomy is necessarily more important than psychology, but because more of the concepts in anatomy require distinct articles to clearly explain (for example, lungs, heart and brain are higher-priority separate articles than ego, supergo and id). Artificial limits will cause more harm than benefit, and more bureaucracy than order.
""again, I would stress usefulness over academic value"" - I partially agree, but remember that academic value is a type of usefulness; Wikipedia is still a general encyclopedia, and not a how-to manual or self-help book. I think I get your point, though I'm not sure I agree (why is ""condom"" more important than ""birth control"" if the concept of condoms, and many other forms of birth control, are surely discussed in the ""birth control"" article, making ""condom"" a daughter article of sorts?).
But those sorts of details can be worked out later; right now, the main issue is how to get from where we're currently at (an overlarge and rather disorderly list of all sorts of ""articles all languages should have"") to where we want to be at (which seems to be two separate lists); should we start going through the list and discussing which entries belong on ""list A"" (1 and 2 on my importance/necessity scale), ""list B"" (3 on my importance/necessity scale), and neither list (less important or necessary than 3)? Or should we just pick out individually the clearly ""list A"" entries (like ""human"", ""science"", ""war"", ""plant""), and then worry about sorting the less noteworthy ones afterwards? In other words, should we start at the top of the list and work our way down the various sections, or start with the most obviously noteworthy ones and then branch outwards into the steadily more ""grey-area"" articles? -"

 Number-limited lists
 The purpose of the list is, primarily, to prioritize article creation/translation for wikipedias, to develop a ""seed"" of usefulness for these wikipedias.
 Usefulness vs. value
 It is far more valuable to have a dozen articles about the US presidency, its position in politics and law, foreign policy, etc. But for someone on the Nepali wp they likely are only interested in information about the current US president. Things people want the answer to now are of greater importance than articles which are extremely useful background information to those pop-culture needs. An article about forms of government is less useful than an article about rice. Priority should be on articles which are extremely popular over many languages, and on simpler over-views rather than in-depth knowledge. Leave room for each language to develop the articles, to make it relevant to their milieu.
 Budgeting numbers of articles
 The majority of these articles will initially be translated by non-native speakers to the wikipedia in question. Maintaining interest beyond the top 1000 for these translators will be difficult; keeping a relatively low number of articles within a field of interest (Humanities, Science...) allows an achievable goal while also giving them a reasonable area of influence (I know much about a subset of human health services, and should be able to have input there, but not in the field of modern culture or history of African cultures.)
 Choosing smaller rather than broader
 Yes, I know I argued the opposite above. The choice of condom vs. human birth control is one of scope. The condom is the most common form of artificial birth control in the world; it requires little explanation in any setting, and its use can be grasped without language. Attempting to explain the cultural relevance of the rhythm method or the legal/religious discussions related to RU-486 would almost certainly be an element of human birth control, and be almost impossible to make translatable to every language. Choices like these should be made, to select what is immediately useful, and reserve the background article for later development.

 My suggestion: set limits; people work better to a limit and a deadline. Set a deadline (Alpha release of list on 1 May 2005, for example), knowing the list will be revised continually but trying to get a product available for translating teams to begin with. Then others may make plans based on the efforts here. Start a section for the top 1000, separate from the over-large list. And begin. - Amgine / talk"

Yes, you are right, it's highly more probable that people look for recent information. However, on the other hand, they have a plenty of souces to find it. Being honest, if only they watch TV news and read newspapers they actually know a bit who is Mr Bush (rare nations are so self-centred as Americans :P ). Some historical or specific data can be much more useful becuase of rarity.
Re other choices (quotas vs. non-quotas, one step vs. 2, 3 or road map etc.) I'm afraid that there is no perfect choice but two- or three- step solution seems to be fine (the language projects are on diferent stages of their development).
Re ways of making decision - I think a larger group of people should be involved and culture-uncentred experts and participants from other language projects should be asked (there does exist a language bareer - English - on Meta). We may agree that present list is anglocentric - just like enWikipedia. The further the culture is from some ""likes"" and standards of en: users, the harder time it gets on en:. People from anglo-saxon world tend to think they are not biased and there was no propaganda (in fact, it still exists there, as at least to some point everywhere, I guess).
In this way we can make this list useful (I think many Wikipedias tend to ignore it and it seems to be quite reasonable for me).

At least for now, such a move would be premature and inefficient. However, I do like very much the idea of distinguishing between the urgently important entries in the list (like ""History"" and ""Earth"" and ""Big Bang""), and other important, but not quite as important, entries in the list (like ""Martial arts"" and ""Tornado"" and ""European Union""), but I think we should distinguish them, at least to begin with, by bolding the more important ones, rather than by doing anything fancy like page-shuffling. In other words, we'll have highly important articles like ""Year"" in bold, but less important articles like the specific months of the year unbolded (though ""Month"" itself may be bolded too). After we've finished trimming the list and bolding the most important entries on the list, then it may be feasible to create one or two smaller lists based on the main list: certainly one that only has the bolded entries, and possibly also one that only has the unbolded ones. The reason for this is that if we start off, before anything's settled yet, by splitting the article up, it will lead to a very disorganized and decentralized situation, and we'll inevitably lose track of a lot of articles in the midst of all the entry-moving and sporadic changes and reverts that will be going on; the two-edit process of removing an article from one list and then adding it to another will, I'm quite certain, cause lots of unnecessary labor, and lots of inconsistencies and repetitions and missed entries. Far simpler to make the process a simple matter of bolding or unbolding certain entries, and far less likely to cause any accidents to occur. Plus it makes it easier to organize the page if we follow your logic and decide that many specific topics (like ""condom"") are more important than general topics (like ""birth control""); by having the two pages merged as one, we can indent ""condom"" properly to show that it's a daughter article of ""birth control"" (since it's a specific type of birth control), but we can bold ""condom"" and leave ""birth control"" unbolded if we end up deciding that condom's important enough for ""List A"", but birth control is only important enough for ""List B"" (which I'd dispute, but I'm just giving a hypothetical example). Likewise, we might want to keep the animal listing as organized as it is now, with ""Insect"" a subarticle of ""Arthropod"" and ""Mammal"" a subarticle of ""Chordate"", but we'll probably end up with ""Mammal"" as a more important article than ""Chordate"" because of what a common and central term it is, in which case we can simply bold ""Mammal"" and leave ""Chordate"" unbolded (unless we end up deciding that ""Chordate"" is so unimportant that we shouldn't even have it on List B, which I'd dispute as well, but that's certainly an option). So, overall, I say it's much better to distinguish the two lists by bolding certain entries and leaving other entries unbolded, at least until the two lists are stable enough that we aren't constantly moving entries from one list to the other (which will surely be the case for some length of time, as we discuss the various placements of each article). Once they're relatively stable, we can use both systems fairly easily. -"

If we do add a third 20th-century American/British pop/rock musician along with Elvis Presley and The Beatles, if anything we should probably go with Michael Jackson, both for his significance as a musician and for his notoriety as a celebrity. But at this point, I don't think we need to add too many similar musicians to the list (though certainly I'm willing to discuss all possibilities, if anyone disagrees!), as it's too easy to risk bloat.

Also, on a side-note, we should probably add Tchaikovsky to the list of musicians and composers; he seems to be the most glaring ommission currently. -"

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	8	 Countries 	0	Silence	07:02, 13 April 2006 (UTC)	"One of the most glaring deficiencies for this page is its complete lack of any recommendations on which countries to have articles for. All it has is a lame cop-out, making the unreasonable and completely unhelpful demand that every Wikipedia have an article on every country, with absolutely no differentiation or prioritization between whether we need an article on India or on Swaziland first. This is both absurd and highly impractical. Clearly the only reason we resorted to this is to avoid any possibility of being accused of bias for choosing one country and not another, but I don't see why this is a problem solely for that part of the page and not for any other. If we managed to be so selective with which religions and languages we included on this list, even though there's just as much of a chance of someone being offended by not having theirs included, then surely we should be able to do the same for ""countries"". At the very least, even if we do not differentiate between countries, we should list them all here, so users don't have to visit another page to see them. But I think that the much more valuable method for dealing with countries would be to handle them consistently and fairly by treating them just the same as articles on every other topic: create a working list, a rough draft, of highly noteworthy and significant countries, and then invite everyone to add and remove entries from the list so we can slowly, over time, chisel it down into the best list we can manage. As a rough goal to aim for, I'd say that we should have about 100 countries total, about 15 of which should be bolded. Obviously this is not set in stone, and can increase or diminish over time (whichever's most beneficial), but I think that's a good place to start from. We should then, if there's worry about disputes arising, provide explanations for why every single country we list is important enough to be included on such a selective list. This will help avoid most of the POV disputes that could arise if we didn't make explicit which aspects of the countries we're choosing (like population, history, economic status, etc.) if justifying its inclusion in the list.

We might want to expand that top 15 up to top 25 so that we can include countries like Italy and Canada (both are G8 countries and of course Italy is historically important) and South Korea, Mexico and Egypt as well.

Alright, those additions seem reasonable enough, though I'm reluctant to add too many bolded entries (because if we have 25-30 rather than 10-15 it'll be much harder to say ""no"" to anyone's requests that we bold more countries, which will eventually make the bolding distinction an irrelevant one because it'll be too large!). Also, ""Spanish language"" (which covers much of Spain's linguistic importance) and ""Ancient Rome"" (which covers much of Italy's historical importance) are already included in the main List, so I don't think bolding them primarily on linguistic and historical grounds is especially necessary (plus the bolded-list already has too much of a Eurocentric bias, having, for example, 0 African countries). Canada, however, is definitely a borderline one, and I've already strongly considered adding it to the list, but have been reluctant partly because of the Anglocentric bias it might demonstrate to have the US, UK, Australia and Canada all on such a short-short list of top-priority countries (I was reluctant to add ""Australia"" originally too, but caved in partly on the grounds that it's the only country that one could also get away with listing as a ""continent"").

As such, even more than recommendations for countries to add to the ""included"" list, I'd love to hear countries that should be removed from the ""included"" list (at least until a good enough rationale can be provided for them being listed).

An issue to consider is if listing all these countries under geography is the way to go. I think listing and linking to the general country articles under some other part of the list (which all include links to geography articles and many other aspects of countries) might be a better approach. The nation state is a basic category of analysis in all macro level social sciences. 

From the current list of 43 countries on the meta page, one could drop Monaco and Vatican City (or move VC to the city list even if VC is a country technically).

In addition to the above, from the list of top 100 countries on your use page, you could drop (mostly because they are tiny -- having high living standard is not everything, as in Barbados and Luxembourg) the following. I don't see why these tiny countries should be on list when larger countries in their region are not: Barbados, Burundi, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Luxembourg, Monaco, Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Slovenia. In another pass, perhaps more countries could be removed. 

Well, I'll try again for Spain and Italy: I think Spain should be a featured country because not only of language but also because of it's history of colonization (related) and being a key power in Europe, its key role in channeling Islamic learning and culture to Europe, the global appeal of Latin culture (of course related to language and colinization), and it would be nice for a Mediterranean power to be featured: either Italy or Spain, I would think. Spain has a very vital history of grass roots democratic movements (a rather important one). Spain is growing again as an economic power -- one of top 10 or 11 in world (though Italy's economy is larger). The legacy of this Spanish (and Italian) versions of socialist political theory in Latin America, Spain and Italy are becoming important on the global stage today through global justice/anti-globalization movements. Very important. Also, Italian and Spanish are amongst the top 10 Wikipedias (not that we want Poland as a top 15 country article, but Wikipedia size is another factor). On Italy: Not only was Italy of fundamental importance in the ancient times but also in the middle ages and also in the Renaissance. Hmm.  If Indonesia is in, we should add Italy and Spain and South Korea, while we're at it.  Perhaps make 20 countries the cut off. --"

I see that the list of countries (and perhaps cities) under the geography section are linked to main multi-disciplinary articles on those. This is very good as the general country articles better coverage of the importance of those countries. These categories may be misplaced. Countries are a main marco level unit of analysis in all the social sciences. I think the country and city articles should be moved from the geography section to the society section. If that makes for a large society category, it can't be helped. Countries as discussed in the linked articles are units of society not geographical topics. Clarity is better than evening things out. --

One could shorten the bolded country list links and much reduce the Euro-centric character of the bolded countries by having EU as a bolded item -- it is in a sense a network state -- and unbolding all European countries.

That's we have ""history"" as its own top-level section, rather than as a sub-section of ""society"" or somesuch; its shorthand for ""events"", like ""geography"" is shorthand for ""places"". So, one big reason not to move ""cities"" or ""countries"" to ""society"", even though they're political and social entities at least as much as geographic, is because it would excessively bloat the ""society"" section and leave the ""geography"" section (which is already relatively small and limited) severely deficient. It's just easier to navigate through the list that way, and it makes such on an intuitive, even if not a technical, level to have countries listed alongside continents.

""Vatican City (or move VC to the city list even if VC is a country technically)."" - I don't want Vatican City removed from the list altogether; its a hugely important city in global religion and even politics, despite its small size. But certainly moving it to the ""Cities"" list seems reasonable to me, even if technically inaccurate; it's only fair, really, considering that ""Hong Kong"" is also listed under ""Cities"".
""Barbados, Burundi, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Luxembourg, Monaco, Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Slovenia. In another pass, perhaps more countries could be removed."" - A good start! I'm delighted to have some removal suggestions, as I have little confidence in my own ability to gauge the importance of most countries. It is indeed true that most of those were added because they scored especially high (or especially low) on certain statistics regarding population, quality of life, poverty, etc.; in lieu of a better way to determine noteworthiness, I went with some lists like that to start from. However, since you justify removing those entries largely based on their size, do keep in mind that I don't think we should consider geographic size a very important factor in inclusion. Population size is much more important; the geographic size of many countries and states is rather arbitrary.
""Also, Italian and Spanish are amongst the top 10 Wikipedias (not that we want Poland as a top 15 country article, but Wikipedia size is another factor)."" - Actually, even though I'm a very big Italian history enthusiast, I'd consider Poland to be almost as important as Italy and Spain, especially if one puts more weight on recent history than on older history. Additionally, I strongly feel that the size of the Wikipedias of certain languages should not be too much considered in determining what should be included in this list, as that would worsen some of Wikipedia's systemic biases (for example, much of the reason certain language Wikipedias have more articles than others is based on how widespread computer and Internet use is, and other cultural factors). Furthermore, your argument about languages, again, is a stronger argument for including ""Italian language"" in the article than for including ""Italy"". However, I'm not strongly opposed to bolding Italy and Spain, so, pending further discussion, although I still have a fair number of reservations, I'm OK with adding them to the bolded list. Thank you for taking the time to explain your reasoning to me; discussions like these are what this list is most in need of.
""If Indonesia is in, we should add Italy and Spain and South Korea, while we're at it."" - Why South Korea and not North Korea? Economic status is not the only factors in choosing countries.
""Perhaps make 20 countries the cut off."" - I don't think we need a hard, absolute cut-off at any specific number, but we should certainly be very careful about which countries we bold and which we don't. Bolding more countries is a slippery slope that could lead (and I personally feel already is starting to lead) to bloat that would make the list much less useful to small Wikipedias.  However, we'll just have to see how things turn out in the long run.
""One could shorten the bolded country list links and much reduce the Euro-centric character of the bolded countries by having EU as a bolded item -- it is in a sense a network state -- and unbolding all European countries."" - Absolutely not. That's a cop-out, and ""European Union"" is already listed where it should be: under ""International organizations"", not ""Countries"". I'm glad you're thinking, though! It is, obviously, more important to avoid bias than it is to avoid the appearance of bias; if there happen to be more highly internationally noteworthy countries in Europe than in Africa, that's just the way things are, and we shouldn't try to change that for the sake of arbitrary Political Correctness. However, we should certainly do our very best to express a global, not just Western, view.
""With that, you have all the most major long term civilization areas of the planet covered."" - The European Union is an economic and political organization, not a civilization. And for that matter, Mexico and Egypt, in their modern forms, are not ""major long term civilizations"" either, even if they coincide geogrraphically and nominally with ancient civilizations; and Italy is not Ancient Rome either. I feel that simply including them on the list, and including civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians and Incas and Romans and Ancient Greeks in the History section (perhaps we should discuss which of those should be bolded, since I haven't gotten around to bolding any of the ""Ancient History"" articles yet?), should suffice, even without bolding. As long as we're rather exclusive with who gets on the list at all, it won't be considered a ""put-down"" to be on the list and not be bolded. It will start to become so if we lower our requirements too much and let Egypt, Mexico, Italy, Spain, and South Korea in, even though obviously all five of those places are very important. -"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	8	 Countries 	11	Vir	05:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)	"Since it is late, here are some points as they pop in my head: If you look at the GDP (PPP) table above, Mexico, Spain and Italy have higher GDP than Indonesia and Canada. That was part of my reasoning there. These are economic superpowers, compared to the rest of the world.  

PC/diversity is a good criteria for including one or a few of the 15 to 20 countries -- I think - so as to have one major country from each continent. Why not? 

No, Egypt doesn't need to go bold. But, for PC reasons, some one African country should. Take your pick: Egypt, Nigeria, or South Africa. Nigeria has quite a large population (9th in world). Also, from memory, Nigeria may have been part of homeland of the expansion which drove the Niger-Congo language family across most of subsaharan Africa along along with a subsaharan package of agriculture. Niger-Congo is arguably the largest language family in the world. 

Mexico is up there in GDP (the PPP version) -- the people and culture of ancient Mexico continue on in Mexico. Huge population too. 

I think EU as a network state is on the way to being a super-country, like the U.S. and Russia and China and India. It is just less centralized (for the time being). I think you dismiss the EU as a unity too quickly (and for ideological reasons?). An argument can be made for reading EU as an economic-political and cultural bloc, more and more so, in various ways. In addition to legal and economic unifications, one key aspect of a modern state is will it defend it's interests militarily in a unified way -- EU is beginning to take small steps in this direction. Done. The big baby regional state is walking. I think it is near inevitable for EU to become a very complex nation state (not unlike India and China, with many languages). EU not a civilization? Hmm. I disagree. Modern Western Europe, while fragmented politically and somewhat linguistically, is a civilization with a great many economic, cultural and techno-scientific continuities (and with extensions around the world). Pomo be damned on that. Of course, now, this western civilization, driven to global supremacy by a complex of factors has been morphing into a global civilization blending with many localities and regional powers and global trends. Granted, most trade is still regional. But, this is gradually changing. (This is frighteningly so in the erosion of regulation, which might reverse eventually. But, how soon?) Anyway...
 
The cultures and empires of classical China, India, Europe, and Indonesia inspired their proximate and later successor states (and civilizations yes) and their diaspora beyond. I think this argument can be made in terms of linguistic, philosophical, religious, etc. continuities (or streams of development). The argument can be less made so for Mexico but I wonder about the areas of high concentration of indigenous population in the south. Persia, Iraq and Egypt are somewhat less so the case in continuity with their classical civilizations -- but their dominant cultures are moreso direct continuities of another great civilization sphere, the Islamic commonwealth. These are not whimsical connections: most of the super states today rest on the foundedations, in cultural-linguistic unity and in sheer population mass, that were established by the large empires of the past. So, your top 15 or 20 list will reflect this. The former colonies -- America, Australia, Brazil, and S. Africa-- seem to be the exceptions (unless you count them as extensions of European civ).  

Btw, I love Peru -- but it just doesn't pop out on the scales we are talking about.

Poland -- I almost mentioned Poland. Important, more so in early modern times. But you were wanting less, not more bolds, and I agree.  The GDP is not quite there. Population neither. Size neither. 

Obviously population is an issue along with country size. These four criteria might do for cut offs in both bold and longer lists: PC (1 on each continent at least), GDP (PPP version), country size, and population size. This favors the legacy states of the old empires. Sigh. Keep it simple? Objective even? 

The tiny countries: many have less than a few million population, even a few 100,000. These are small lakes of humanity compared to the oceans of humanity in large states.  New York or Mexico City or Mumbai alone would swallow 20 or more of them.  You are wanting a shorter list yes? I agree for top level encyclopedia purposes. If doing a course on states or an article on the nature of states: bring in all the variety. 

I only mentioned the Wiki thing for Spain as one among many factors. If GDP is a key factor, Spain really should go in. 

The more I think of it, the more I am found of the idea of de-bolding all the European places and just going with the EU -- all the European states are one click away then -- not just the big ones.  Be bold and unbold, eh? :) 

Viewing the world as a global system: what are the major powers in the world today?  U.S., EU (gradually increasingly more so than the individual countries), India, China, Japan, Russia still for awhile (and maybe it will regenerate), Brazil perhaps, Mexico perhaps eventually, an Islamic alliance perhaps, a unified Korea perhaps (even ununified) or even an Asian economic bloc, a South American Union including Brazil perhaps and an African Union down the road and a SE Asain alliance. We are moving to an era of large regional states mostly as geopolitical players. Who else is can/will force their will in an era of various globalizations?  Large states are necessary developments in the face of (and sadly as instruments of) the force of transnational corporations and financial markets moving massive monetary and trade flows around. (Global networks of social movements, right and left, are fighting this, but won't stop it.) Times have changed. Perhaps let our outlines reflect this to an extent. 

Why South Korea only? Why Russia and not Ukraine? Look at the GDP (PPP) chart. S. Korea is in Top 15. One could check other types of GDP tables at the link above to get different takes.  

Geography should perhaps be renamed to Places and Geography. Geography is quite misleading. Why have an encyclopedia with obfuscation at the top level. I'm not a fan of one word lables when two are three words accomplish much more (and indicate all sort of interesting connections) -- especially in a long list format like this.  In a table to manage data, OK, maybe you want single words. But you need clear labels for organizing meaning. --"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	8	 Countries 	12	Silence	18:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)	"""Mexico, Spain and Italy have higher GDP than Indonesia and Canada. That was part of my reasoning there. These are economic superpowers, compared to the rest of the world."" - But Indonesia has the 4th-largest population in the world! Compared to Spain (43,000,000), Egypt (75,000,000), Italy (60,000,000), Mexico (100,000,000), and South Korea (48,000,000), Indonesia (220,000,000) is a people superpower! Like I said earlier, economic status should not be our primary factor in determining what countries should be bolded. Population shouldn't either, but both popluation and economic status should only be sufficient to require bolding for the top 5 or so countries on the list; when we're getting down to below the top 10 (as you are getting with South Korea, etc.), more is required.
""PC/diversity is a good criteria for including one or a few of the 15 to 20 countries -- I think - so as to have one major country from each continent. Why not?"" - Because it's wasteful. We already have an article on each continent bolded. Like I said before, the list should be based on which countries are most internationally important, not based on which countries would make us look most PC. That's one of the main reasons I'd much rather have 10 countries bolded than 20: when you're only choosing about 10 countries out of a total of 7 continents, it's completely forgivable to not have a country from every continent bolded, and to have various other important countries not bolded. But when the requirements for bolding are so low that 20 countries make the list, it becomes a lot trickier to keep the list neutral and NPOV. I do't know that we really want to deal with that.
""No, Egypt doesn't need to go bold. But, for PC reasons, some one African country should."" - Not if we find a way to shorten the list of bolded countries rather than grow it.
""Take your pick: Egypt, Nigeria, or South Africa."" - All three of those countries are tempting. I'd also strongly consider the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Wikipedia claims that it is the only African country with a significant chance of becoming a major power this century, was the site of the deadliest conflict since World War II, and is the 12th-largest country in the world.
""I think EU as a network state is on the way to being a super-country, like the U.S. and Russia and China and India."" - This is extremely speculative. EU's territory spans a much larger area than even the U.S. and China, and the vast majority of the EU's influence and international role is economic, not administrative. At this point, listing Europe (or the European Union) as a single country would be akin to listing the Middle East (or the Arab League) as one.
""I think you dismiss the EU as a unity too quickly (and for ideological reasons?)"" - What the hell? Forgetting to assume good faith, there? What ""ideological reasons"" are you insinuating that I have? I'm offended.
""An argument can be made for reading EU as an economic-political and cultural bloc, more and more so, in various ways."" - The same argument could be made for reading the United States and Canada as an economic-political and cultural bloc, but that doesn't make them the same country. Jeez.
""The GDP is not quite there. Population neither. Size neither."" - The GDP and population are significant factors (though not overwhelmingly so), but the size of a certain country really isn't all that significant. The United Kingdom is the 78th-largest country in the world, yet surely you wouldn't call it less important than Kazakhstan, the 9th-largest country in the world, based on its size! I think we should stop worrying about geographic size so much; just because the countries are listed under ""Geography"" as a matter of convention (because they deal with places, even if those places are more geopolitically- than geographically-based) doesn't mean that their geographic features (such as altitude and climate and area) are of the highest importance.
""one key aspect of a modern state is will it defend it's interests militarily in a unified way -- EU is beginning to take small steps in this direction."" - So? There are plenty of places that the United States would defend if attacked, that aren't a part of the United States. By your logic, the various twisted alliances in and preceding World War I constituted the formation of new countries just because the alliances required various countries to militarily defend each other. Until the European Union article is in a ""Countries"" category rather than an ""International organizations"" category (look at the bottom of the page!), your revolutionary reclassification theories are premature (and potentially offensive to many Europeans, who wouldn't want their countries removed from the list of important Countries just because they're members of a major international organization).
""Obviously population is an issue along with country size."" - No, population is a major issue, size is a minor one. Antarctica is less internationally important than India despite being about four times as large geographically. If a country has large expanses of uninhabitable desert, why should that country be deemed more important than another country that would be equally large if one counted the significantly-inhabited regions only? Raw map size is a factor, but not a major one; Russia is bolded more for its historical and political importance than for its sheer size. The same applies to the U.S., India, Brazil and China; their size is a minor contributing factor to their being bolded, at best.
""If GDP is a key factor, Spain really should go in."" - GDP is not a key factor (at least, not past the top 5 or so on the GDP list). GDP is certainly an important factor, but there are dozens of other important factors.
""The more I think of it, the more I am found of the idea of de-bolding all the European places and just going with the EU"" - A truly terrible idea. I'd actually say that the EU is currently vastly less important than a number of existing countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom (was the British Empire a ""country"", based on your evaluation?). Clearly your political leanings and hopes for the future are preventing you from making an unbiased evaluation of Europe. Perhaps you should stick to other continents until you get some hard evidence that EU is a country or get over that fantasy so that country-inclusion can be discussed reasonably. Even if EU becomes a country sometime in the future (which Wikipedia obviously shouldn't speculate about until it's actually happened!), it's blatantly clear that it's not one now, which is all that should matter to us.
""Times have changed. Perhaps let our outlines reflect this to an extent."" - Nope. Times have changed a great deal, yes, and we should reflect that in our list, but none of the developments you're fantasizing about (such as a unified, singular ""Asian bloc"" of power) are anywhere near actually existing at this point in time, or even in the foreseeable future. Your starry-eyed speculation about the future, no matter how strong your personal convictions are, cannot override the facts. Until Atlases and other encyclopedias start printing data based solely on these imaginary, futuristic supercountries instead of based on the actual, internationally-recognized existing countries of today, it would clearly be overstepping the line and POV-pushing to restructure a list like this based on absolute speculation. I, too, believe that the world is becoming increasingly globalized and centralized, and will continue to do so in the future, but that doesn't mean that we can rewrite the global geopolitical landscape for our own purposes just because we want to. Encyclopedias should reflect the facts of the past and present, not the imagined possibilities of the future; Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Moreover, ""viewing the world as a global system"" is just one way of viewing the world. Presenting hypothetical future situations as present-day truths is clearly a violation of Wikipedia's core policies, Neutral point of view, Verifiability, and No original research.
""Why Russia and not Ukraine?"" - Because Russia is much more historically and politically significant (not to mention, since you're so fond of comparing countries' sizes, that it's the largest country in the entire world). That I added Ukraine to the list at all is more than sufficient. Answering a question with another question is not answering the question at all; why South Korea and not North Korea?
""Look at the GDP (PPP) chart. S. Korea is in Top 15."" - I honestly don't especially care. Mexico, Spain and Italy all have a much higher GDP than South Korea, yet they aren't bolded either. This is a list of the most important topics for a small-sized Wikipedia to have articles about, not a raw list of which countries have the highest GDPs. In fact, there'd be even fewer high-GDP countries bolded if so many countries with huge populations and a lot of political influence didn't happen to also have high GDPs; the fact that the GDP coincides nicely with some of the bolded entries is just that: a coincidence. GDP is not the be-all and end-all of the entire history, culture, geography, politics, social structure, and all other significant factors of every country in existence, and bolding countries based solely on their economic status is itself biased, because it forwards the idea that a country is only and entirely important because it has lots of money. Obviously things aren't quite that simple.
""Geography is quite misleading."" - No more misleading than ""history"" is. ""Geography"" deals with places, ""history"" with events. The fact that ""Geographic"" lists certain countries and other divisions that are geopolitical more than strictly geographic is no more significant than the fact that ""History"" lists certain events that are actually prehistoric! For that matter, ""Biography"" isn't confined solely to biographic data; it's just about ""People"". If you wanted, you could rename ""Geography"" to ""Places"", ""History"" to ""Events and periods"", and ""Biography"" to ""People""; it'd be more accurate, it just wouldn't look as pretty. It's a pretty trivial issue. I'm more concerned with improving the list than with minor semantic quibbles like that. If you want clearer labels, I recommend simply adding brief descriptions clarifying the title's meaning to the beginning of those sections: add a single-sentence explanation at the top of ""Biography"" to note that it's for articles about people (not for articles about biographies!), at the top of ""History"" to note that it's for articles about events and periods in human (pre)history, and at the top of ""Geography"" to note that it's not just for strictly geographical topics, but for all sorts of articles about places. Would that be sufficient clarification? We could likewise add clarifying lines to the beginning of ""Society"" and ""Culture"" and ""Technology"", since those are all pretty abstract and vague concepts, and non-native-English-speakers may not fully understand them (and, for example, ""Technology"" is sometimes considered a subgrouping under ""Culture"", at other times a subgrouping under ""Science""). A little bit of clarifying text should clear up most of that obfuscation you speak of without having to completely overhaul the page. It's particulraly important to use one-word section names rather than multi-word ones because this page is for numerous non-English Wikis, and simpler words like ""Geography"" are better than lengthy, elaborate clauses explaining the exactitudes of the section's requirements. (Of course, that's anoter good argument for just going with ""People"", ""Places"" and ""Events"" rather than fanciness of ""Biography"", ""Geography"" and ""History"". But then, that's another thing to discuss.) -"

I didn't mean to offend. I think you took offense too easily. No offense was intended. I meant by ""ideological"" that you had a theory that you strongly cared about in this and believed. (ps. various definitions of en:ideology are not ""judgemental."") That was the only topic on which you had previously said ""absolutely"" not. So, that sounded like a very strong belief. It is not meant as an insult. I was figuring we could joust back and forth here with ideas and critiques.  I was partly jousting (a common thing in academic circles that I sadly spend too much time in) because your previous reply had seemed a bit dismissive about the EU state idea. Actually, I was just using contemporary social theory. See last paragraph below about Castells.

To the point: I think your counter examples above are not the best counters that could be given to the points I've made, which have more substance than you're granting. For instance, I mentioned repeatedly that EU is emerging as a ""Network"" state -- that is distinct from a country.  The network state is a different type of beast from the traditional capitalist nation state. But, it is an emerging type of state, for the EU. Wikipedia may not write about it yet. But, we should and will. I did say that down the road that an African bloc etc. might emerge and was in no way implying that was close to a reality.  

Though you criticized me for emphasizing some individual factors, I mentioned that 4 or 5 factors could be used together in selecting countries to bold. My general ideas in this have been considering various factors (see Spain at top), though my arguments may have emphasized specifics at times. For later: At the end of discussions such as this, I think it could help to summarize what factors are used to select bolded and general items.

Using one word titles for phrases for translation is an interesting point. Perhaps subtitles would be a way to get around this. People, places and events might be better. And nature for science. But, hmm, nature and science and place and geography still seem better to me. I don't think these are so difficult to translate. Very common words. --"

I don't necessarily feel that these kinds of articles/lists/projects need to be NPOV (such a thing would be entirely impossible), but the pretentions of this one seem a bit much, more even than lists of the 100 greatest films and the like.  In fact, I'm not against lists like this at all--I think they serve a valuable purpose, and we shouldn't waste out time wringing our hands about how to come up with a non-NPOV version of this list--but I think we should try to be clearer about the POV that they represent."

The list isn't going to grow uncontrolled, because not too many people are working on it, and obvious cruft can get cleared away.    Of course the list will tend to grow as it goes on.  It's got some weird biases at the moment - towards computer scientists, for instance; is it really more important to have an article on Dennis Ritchie than it has to have one on, say, Marsupials or Henry VIII?  Of course not.  It just happens that the people who have contributed to the list have tended to be computer nerds.  The way to fix this is not to set some arbitrary number, but to allow the list to gradually balance itself by leaving it open and encouraging people to add names.  Every once in a while, somebody can come through and clear particularly bad names, like the obscure Norwegian politicians, minor American authors, and semi-legendary female rulers (the Queen of Sheba was on the list, but not King Solomon!  That's entirely absurd) who had somehow crept in when I found the place.  The basic fact is that there are well more than a thousand articles that all languages should have articles on, and any limitation is basically going to bias the list in favor of the currently odd balance, because people always feel more willing to add names than to remove them. The page is basically a goal for starting up wikipedias - these are articles that are reasonably high priority to add, on a basis which is hopefully beyond that of individual cultures, although of course it has a western, and particularly an anglophone, bias because of who has contributed to it.  Limiting the list, I think, especially to a number that has already been surpassed, will just stunt it and leave it with an odd, idiosyncratic set of choices.

I think a better approach, in any case, would be to create separate 100-article lists of important articles in certain areas: 100 most important cities, 100 most important authors, 100 most important politicians throughout history, etc. From these lists, the main 1,000-article list could be compiled if desired. This would be good for starting WikiProjects at our smaller wikis, since they have a decent number of articles to work on. It would also be useful for smaller projects, for which less specific topics, like historical events (wars etc.), would be a higher priority than individual figures in history; for which articles on the major languages are more important than articles on the writers that represent them. –

The idea of smaller lists does seem like a good idea.  I'd suggest, though, that something like ""the 100 most important politicians"" rapidly gets silly, just as ""the 1000 most important encyclopedia article topics"" does.  The more specific the better.  ""100 Most important British potlical figures,"" for instance, would make sense, because that allows for a level of commensurability - British political figures are essentially comparable to one another, and can thus be compared and a decent list thought up.  ""100 most important European monarchs"" would seem a sensible idea for a list - big enough to give some room to be expansive, small and specific enough that all examples are readily comparable.  Similarly, dividing up authors, either by nationality or by genre (or both) would likely give more comparable lists.  It's easier to say who the ""100 most important writers in the English language,"" or the ""100 most important poets"" are than it is to say who the ""100 most important writers"" are.  But that's just a refinement of your idea, which I think is a good one.  Once the more specific lists are made, one can move up a pyramid to construct broader and broader lists, until one gets to this one.  It's a rather expansive project, though. I think the basic issue is that there's just a ton of articles that an encyclopedia ought to have articles on, and that any genuinely full list is going to be highly discouraging. But I like making lists, so I'm going to fiddle about thinking about some of this."

Yes, I like the idea of having more specific topics for lists, but it creates a lot more work, and I'm not sure we can find enough people to do it here at Meta. Though maybe it's possible over at the English Wikipedia, where some contributors have obviously been working towards a ""1.0 release"".

Looking first at English language authors, I will note some people who seem to have been forgotten, and some who probably should not be on there.

 Isaac Asimov
Chinua Achebe, perhaps, to include an African anglophone author?
 Jane Austen
 William Blake
 Lord Byron
What has happened to Charles Dickens?  Isn't he more important than Isaac Asimov?  What about Geoffrey Chaucer?
 Emily Dickinson
John Donne is perhaps worth mentioning.
 Arthur Conan Doyle
William Faulkner? George Eliot?  T. S. Eliot? Ralph Waldo Emerson? Henry Fielding?  
 F. Scott Fitzgerald
 Dashiell Hammett
 Nathaniel Hawthorne
 Ernest Hemingway
 Langston Hughes
 Samuel Johnson?
 James Joyce
John Keats?  Herman Melville? Christopher Marlowe?
 Edna St. Vincent Millay
Millay is distinctly non-essential.  Does anyone evern read her anymore?
 Arthur Miller
John Milton?  
 Edgar Allan Poe
 Ezra Pound?
 Carl Sandburg
Sandburg is even more non-essential than Millay.  Sir Walter Scott, as the inventor of the historical novel, should perhaps be considered.
 William Shakespeare
 George Bernard Shaw
 Mary Shelley
Percy Bysshe Shelley has traditionally been considered a more important literary figure than his wife.
 Robert Louis Stevenson
 Stevenson doesn't seem terribly essential, especially given the 19th century novelists who've been left off.  I'd say Anthony Trollope, at least, is of greater note.
 Alfred, Lord Tennyson?
 J. R. R. Tolkien
 I suppose the fanboys must be appeased...
 Mark Twain
 H. G. Wells
 Walt Whitman
 Oscar Wilde
William Wordsworth, surely? And Virginia Woolf?
 William Butler Yeats

Next, to the French language:

 Alexandre Dumas
 Victor Hugo
 Molière
 Marcel Proust
 Jean-Paul Sartre
 Jules Verne

First, note the incredibly bias towards English over French.  Second, Dumas and Verne are not particular giants.  Getting past that, surely there should be Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, Albert Camus, Gustave Flaubert, Michel de Montaigne, François Rabelais, Jean Racine, Arthur Rimbaud, Stendhal, Paul Verlaine, Emila Zola, for a start.

Next, to the German:

 Bertolt Brecht
 Brothers Grimm
 Hildegard of Bingen
 Franz Kafka
 Thomas Mann
 Rainer Maria Rilke

All good choices (well, I don't really know who Hildegard of Bingen is, but otherwise.)  But, umm, isn't there something missing here?  Something enormous missing?  Oh yeah...Johann Wolfgang Goethe, the most important writer in the German language.  Also Friedrich Schiller should probably be on here, and perhaps Heinrich Heine as well.  There's other possibilities.

For Russians

 Anton Chekhov
 Fyodor Dostoevsky
 Aleksandr Pushkin
 Leo Tolstoy

In this case, at least, we seem to have stuck with the most important four.  There's others who might be added - Ivan Turgenev, Mikhail Lermontov, Nikolai Gogol from the 19th century; various writers like Gorky, Bulgakov, Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn for the 20th...

There aren't any Italians.  Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio should probably be added, for a start.

Finally, and I'll stop here, for classical writers:

 Aristophanes
 Homer
 Sappho
 Sophocles
 Virgil

All good, but surely Aeschylus, Euripides, Horace, and Ovid should all be added.  There's a bunch of others one could note - Hesiod, Pindar, Catullus, Cicero, Plautus, Terence, and so forth.

Anyway, I await any comment.  What are the rules about adding names?  I see that it says there's to be a thousand articles, how strong of a guideline is that?"

All the countries should be included, as they are of different importance for different people. And it does not make a difference whether there are 100 countries on the list or all approx 200. Although this is in opposition with my argument at the cities section, that the list should not be too wide, the countries are a different case as the number is considerably smaller that the number of possible cities to include.

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	21	 Countries 2 	3	Akigka	02:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)	" I don't think that any disucssion based on ""reasoned rationale"" made by anyone (whose rationale is necessartily biased by his own cultural environment) will ever be conclusive.
 The only bias-neutral list will one based purely on statistics collected from existing wikipedias. That's why I much favor making the list simply not sorted by topic or domain, but simply by pure statitics collected on at least the top-10 major wikis:
 the articles with the greatest number of interwikis
 sorted secondarily with the greates number of local links in those wikis.
 The choice of source wikis to check should be the top-most ones, because the smallest ones have sometimes been expanded by bots importing massive numbers of stub articles with little importance (for example a list of French or US cities, whose source is easy to get, and easy to automate, and so easy to put in first place in the list of top-interwikis). This is the reason why I also think that getting the statistics about the articles with the most important number of local links is a big hint about how important a topic is, even on the largest interwikis.
 I think you will be surprized to see that all the rationale above about which article to select is completely wrong, and totaly biased.
 The list should not remainstatic, but should be updated each month after statistic collection. There would then be reports on all wikis to see how they implement the list: stubs would be created for missing articles, but this will still not allow changing much the local links statistics. So the ""global culture"" improved by the interwikicollection willnot completely erase the regional culture viewed by local links.
 The two aspects (interwikis, and local links) are important: if a wiki has an article with lots of local links, it is most probably important to have it also in other languages, at least as a stub to be improved later, but from which the interwiki collection can start (collecting interwikis will help improving these stubs, by enhancing the translation effort).
 More generally, such lists will really benefit to all wikis because lots of useful information will be found in other languages for articles with poor quality in some languages (including in the English, German or French wikis that have concentrated lots of efforts).
 Additionally, these statistical lists should be developed (separately) on other interesting namespaces (""Template:"", ""Category:"" and ""Portal:"") because they will help maintaining the general coherence of wikipedias and will allow wikis to improve their own local maintenance, typography, general aspect, and organization/classification of the content. Such tool would rapidly demonstrate that most wikis (including English!) could be largely improved with less centric bias, and more openness to other cultures and knowledge domains.
 These lists don't need to be sorted by domain. A pure statistic sort is enough (at least at the start). The classification by domain will follow the general evolution of wikis for their local organization of their own content!
 Then completing the list by cultural/scientific domain should be done later after classification has been made with the main article namedpace, by collecting interwikis statistics on the ""category:"" namespace (for the top-100 most-wanted categories): note that statistics on locallinksto categories is a non-sense as the level of detail will be high in wikis with well structured categories, but the corresponding level of local links will be realtively low in those wikis).
 Such statistical lists can then initiate new maintenance projects in all wikis, and this will give very interesting hints to contributors about where to put their efforts (creation, translation, organization, ...). It will also help solving local conflicts by looking at what has been done in other more local wikis (where there will be more experts in some cultural domains, and probably more external references). Verdy_p, 22:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC).
 How about taking out the countries category altogether and leaving just the note saying that any wikipedia edition should eventually have an article about all the 200+ independent countries in the world. That is, I believe, how it was done originally. The list as a whole is still too long and could do with more cuts. I agree that it would be impossible to create an unbiased list of 30-40 countries that are recommended for any wikipedia edition to have. Also, this list seems highly susceptible to spurious additions (anonymous users adding supposed their country silently to the list). --"

With this criteria, the list will soon reach several hundred cities. I don't oppose the relative importance and I am sorry to have picked up two Irish cities, but it should be decided, how many cities to include to high-priority list at all. For example, I could easily add Ljubljana, the largest Slovenian-speaking city, or Zagreb, the capital of Croatia or Cardiff, the capital of Wales or Khartoum, the capital of the largest country in Africa or whatever. Still, the list can be pretty wide and it might not be a bad idea. However, if I get the idea of this list right, it should contain a relatively small amount of impotrant articles from different areas, so I would not expand it at the cities part too much.

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	32	 List getting (way) too long 	0	Akigka	10:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)	This list currently contains more than 1500 articles. This means that to avoid perverting its original purpose we need to eliminate some 500 articles from the list. Any suggested candidates? --
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	32	 List getting (way) too long 	1	Akigka	11:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)	 If I might suggest a method to cut down this list it would be to drastically reduce the biographies section (currently 1/3 of the entire list), flatten the list and remove most of the twice and three times nested lists. E.g. in the section on specific religions we have, in addition to the names of major world religions, many lists of founders, holy books, sacred sites etc. Shouldn't we simply assume that once the article on the religion itself is created somewhere in the wikiverse, in all likelihood, the rest will follow naturally? Anyway, it seems obvious to me that this list is getting too long which IMHO reduces its usefulness for new/small wikipedias who would otherwise put it to good use (e.g. to contrast particularist/national/cultural bias). I therefore suggest that suggestions of new additions should always be accompanied with suggestions of an equal amount of deletions. --

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	32	 List getting (way) too long 	5	Akigka	22:40, 7 January 2007 (UTC)	" After cutting down the biographies section to 200 and shortening the countries/cities section the list is now, I'm happy to say, only 1131 articles long - i.e. 131 articles short of being 1000 entries long. It seems that it is the biographies section (because it's at the top?) and the countries/cities section that are most in danger of spurious edits/additions that grow the list out of proportion. It has to be kept in mind that this is not a list of ""most important topics in wikipedia"" but simply a useful tool for smaller wikipedias to use. I therefore suggest the following:
 For an addition to the list to be kept it has to be matched with a deletion
 The biographies section and the geography section should be moved to the bottom of the list
 I made some extensive cuts to the list and removed some 100 entries from it - all very worthy topics. I believe this was necessary to get the list down to 1000 entries. It is now 1021 entries long, according to my count. I do think that the rule of one deleted entry per added entry should be used to keep the list from becoming bloated out of proportion, which is what prompted these cuts in the first place. The idea of someone adding to the list and someone else having to do the cutting does not seem fair. Also, adding an entry becomes more of a difficult decision if you also have to remove something else instead, thus discouraging spurious additions. If someone thinks I am being too radical and thinks this list would also be useful at, say 1300 or 1500 entries, I believe that should be discussed here before it is allowed to happen. Anyway, some limit is necessary, IMHO, to keep this list useful for small wikipedias, which is its purpose - again - not to be a list of everybody's idea of ""the most important topics in the world"". --"

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	33	 The Quechua Test 	0	Boivie	18:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)	"I was diverted to this page from checking on on Wikipedia in Quechua. The Quechua are a group descended from the Incas and now living in the highlands of the Andes from Colombia to Argentina.

So, I am looking at the list from a Quechua perspective, and considering the making of the Quechua Wikipedia. Things I notice:

1: as mentioned, a very strong anglo-saxon bias
2: a lack of certain key articles that someone Quechua might consider of importance to the World: the Inca Empire, the Spanish Conquest of the Americas, etc

Now, certain topics are clearly key to everyone. Such ""World-key"" items might include:

People:
George W Bush

History:
Nazi Germany

Geography:
Ocean

Society:
Law

etc.

Others might be of particularly Quechua interest, and would be added to the Quechua Wikipedia naturally in time: details of countries and provinces in the Quechua zone, Tupac Amaru, Quechua literary figures, etc. But, many of the topics in this list of 1000 seem of little relevance; I wonder how many people would want to read about the plasma state of matter or the Thirty Years War in Quechua.

So I propose: The Quechua Test

To have a place on this list, every topic should be of interest and importance to a Quechua speaker. By a Quechua, I mean perhaps ""someone you guys don't know much about"". It could be an actual Quechua in Bolivia or someone speaking a minor language anywhere else in the world. So, here's a profile of our ""Quechua"":

1: minor languages are either spoken by people who are also (perhaps more) fluent in a major language (e.g. Welsh and English) or by people who are not. I propose that this list be catered more toward the latter category: for them, their wikipedia is a necessity for access to information rather than an extravagance.

2: these peoples will generally lack access to many things we take for granted. There are very few websites in Quechua apart from the Quechua Wikipedia. Most major computer programs are not available in Quechua translations, for instance, so the relevance of specific articles on many computer languages is of less relevance as readers will be unable to learn how to use them.

3: education is often at a lower level for monolingual speakers of minority languages, so we should include well-written articles on what might be considered basic topics in English Wikipedia.

This will give us a core list more suited to the use intended: this is not supposed to be a list of the most important articles in English Wikipedia, but rather one of the most necessary articles in a minority language. I am in favor of a list of much fewer than 1000 articles, perhaps 200 to make the project of creating them less daunting to a small group of bilingual wikipedians with access to the relevant information. I also suggest the creation of stripped down pages on these topics, edited in English with the aim of an easily translatable but informative piece.

As a final suggestion, perhaps we could include ""floating"" entries -- ones that are different depending on what language it is, e.g:

The Presidents of countries where this language is spoken
Diseases most common to speakers of this language
Cultures of groups adjacent to that of this language

or we could assume that those will be created naturally anyway.

Interesting thoughts. About stripped down pages, try the Simple English Wikipedia. Their articles are usually suitable for translation. --"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	34	 Eliminate bias in Authors, playwrights and poets 	0	Ecelan	12:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC)	"My proposal is:
3 authors for major languages (Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi)
2 authors major literatures (French, German, Japanese, Farsi, etc.)
2 authors for ancient and classical lenguages
1 author for other lenguages/literatures/authors that are important

It would look like something like this:
Classical languages:
Greece: Homer, Sophocles
Rome: Virgil,  Horace
Major languages:
Chinese: Li Bai
English: Shakespeare, William, Shaw, George Bernard, Byron, Lord
Spanish: Cervantes, Miguel de, Calderón de la Barca, Neruda, Pablo
Arabic: Abu Nuwas, Gibran, Khalil, Mahfouz, Naguib
Hindi: author1?, author2?, author3?
Big literatures:
French: Molière, Hugo, Victor, Camus, Albert
Japanese: Murasaki, Bashō
Italian: Dante Alighieri, Boccaccio, Giovanni
Russian: Dostoevsky, Fyodor, Tolstoy, Leo
German: Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, Kafka, Franz
Farsi: Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam
Portuguese: Camões, Luís de, Pessoa, Fernando
Turkish: Fuzûlî, author2?
Other Indian languages, ...
Other cases:
Czech: Hašek, Jaroslav
Yiddish: Singer, Isaac Bashevis
Norwegian: Ibsen, Henrik
Swedish: Lagerlöf, Selma
Corean, Modern greek, Swahili, Thai, Lao, Breton, Sicilian, Albanian, Polish, Finnish, Serbian, etc.

Of course there is much to discuss here. Do all languages have authors that are worth putting on the list (see Breton or Sicilian)? What languages have major literatures? What authors are to be selected in every language? For instance, for Spanish, I have chosen a novelist, a playwright and a poet, and tried to take two classical and one modern, one American and two Spaniards, to try to achieve a bit of equilibrium, but there some other I could have chosen. This should be done with all other languages, but always respecting the limits.

I'll wait for comments. If no one objects I may change the list. Cheers, --"

But I think it might be better (but more difficult) to look at the notability of the authors in different part of the world, than to strictly go for a certain number of authors from each language. An approach I would like is to try to find out Which Asian authors are known in America? and Which African authors are known in China? and similar questions. However feel free to make the adjustments you think is good, then we'll see if someone change it. --

Quotas like you suggest are one (highly controversial) way of doing so. However, you already seem to introduce bias by your premises: What is the definition of a ""major language"" for example? Or a ""big literature""? Why should novels, poetry and plays be selected over all other forms of verbal expression (i.e. folklore, short stories)? The main point is that we have only so much space on a list of ""articles all wikipedias should have"" that should (at least in principle) be limited to a 1000 articles to be practical. The way you suggest would inevitably either come up with way too many candidates, or be so limited as to be susceptible to systematic bias anyway. It's basically like this: pick those that in your opinion constitute the world's top three novelists out of all the novelists in the world... Such a short list will always be susceptible to someone's perception of bias. --"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2006	34	 Eliminate bias in Authors, playwrights and poets 	3	Ecelan	19:25, 21 December 2006 (UTC)	"First of all, thanks for anwering.
In a list like this, where you have the best of anything, unless you have objective means of measuring, you will always have a subjective list and thus a bias. I think we can all agree on that. The point is to try to make that bias as small as possible. Right now, 29 of 95 (about 30%) writers listed use English; 1 of 95 use Chinese. Chinese has a literature that is 2500 years old and 900 million speakers. I think we can do better than that.
Boivie, the idea you propose still has a big bias in favor of western culture and mainly English speaking literature. Ask the people around you and you will see just how few know anything about Persian, Thai or Hindi literature. With that method, the first author on the list would be J. K. Rowling, the second Tolkien and the third Dan Brown. I'm not saying these should not go in the list, but I'd prefer Shakespeare any day. 
The list I have proposed tries to combine the bias of a subjective list with some rules that would objecivize it a little bit. We would do what Akigka says (world's top three novelists), but instead the Ø/two/three best writers of the X language and we just take the most important languages.
Of course we'll still have to discuss what language goes where and what writers should be listed. To decide which literatures are big shouldn't really be that difficult. Let's just say: several centuries of existence, a certain number of writers, number of speakers, a (modern) publishing industry with X titles per year, etc. all these should be objective criteria. We can adjust these criteria so that we get the numbers we need. For ""major languages"" we just have to take the 5 (or less) most spoken, but I would at least take Chinese and English. 
Personally I really would have flexible criteria on what goes where (and not so many rules) and combine them with common sense, but one way or the other, you would always have a frame to keep you grounded.
Cheers, --"

I would first, however, like to go over the list and simply reduce it to ca 50 entries. We need to cut this list by some 300 entries to keep it 1000 entries long. What worries me most is that it seems to grow by undiscussed, anonymous and seemingly spurious additions. This severely limits its usefulness, which I think is important to consider. --

en:Shen Kuo seems to be the most impressive Song-era Chinese scientist.
en:Brahmagupta was an Indian astronomer-mathematician.
en:Aryabhata was another Indian  astronomer-mathematician.
en:Panini was a grammarian and linguist, but seems to be the greatest one from ancient times.  His name comes up again and again in histories of India and Indian philosophy.  He standardized Sanskrit and philosophized via language.  Perhaps he should be put on one of these lists.  He could replace en:Chanakya for example among the thinkers.

I'd pick Brahmagupta, already present in 27 Wikipedias, as a replacement for Fibonacci, who was merely a transmitter of ideas from the East.  Fibonacci himself refers to the ""method of the Indians"" - so why place him over those he imitated?  Or Aryabhata would work on the scientists list as well.  Both influenced deeply later Arabic and European math and science.  Panini could replace Chanakya among the social scientists.  What do you think?"

First of all, I do think that the en:Mali Empire should be here, as one of the few acknowledgments of Africa on this list.  This medieval/early modern list is heavily European, although Europe was not yet dominant in the world, particularly not in the middle ages when it was a decidedly weak region.  A full 11 of the 16 articles are about Europe!  In addition, the en:Mughal Empire of India certainly belongs on the list as one of the major early modern empires (and the sole representative of India on the list).  Yes, Akbar is already listed as a major leader, but so are plenty of leaders whose states or events appear elsewhere.

I think we should consider adding en:Mamluk.  This was a very important Muslim sultanate and military phenomenon generally (see article).  The phenomenon as a whole is certainly more important than en:Saladin, although the latter's fame means that I still might not want to remove him.  Saladin and Mamluk are both medieval-era aspects of the Arab world...

With regard to Africa, perhaps en:Voodou could be added as well.  I'd have to consider what to remove though.

That's all for now."

 I don't think any voting here can be so very deciding. Changes in the list spoil statistics and reduce the value of the standard list. Sure enough every living patriot would prefer to see his country on the list (and will find many reasons and many voters to do that).

First, I think en:Fire should be replaced by en:Combustion. Combustion is a broader and much more well defined term which refers to the whole process of burning something. Fire perhaps refers more to the visible flame. 

Second, I think it would be nice if the fuels en:Petroleum, en:Coal and en:Biofuel would be included (I think they have been at some point). Petroleum and coal are obviously very important while biofuels are the primary fuels in the developing world. I do not exactly know what to remove though. I am a bit sceptic about en:Steam engine, it is only historically important, and there is already the article en:Industrial revolution. The simple machines, en:Lever, en:Pulley, en:Screw and en:Wheel are perhaps not so necessary either (wheel seems to be the most important). en:Nanotechnology is also a very small field of engineering and hardly deserves a slot. --"

They could be replaced by en:Petroleum, en:Coal, en:Biofuel and en:Windpower (en:Nuclear power is already included elsewhere, and if the line has to be drawn somewhere, en:Natural gas can be left out). Anyway, having both the fuels and their umbrella terms is too much. If I could choose what is more important in an encyclopedia, I think the individual fuels would be more important. Then only two other articles have to be removed, and I think one could be en:Nanotechnology and the other one of the simple machines. Not sure I agree with removing the computer or electrical terms though.

I agree that en:Machine should be included! A very basic term. The fact that the english articles is short is no reason - it would be a signal to english wikipedia that it needs to be improved. English wikipedia is in general not so good on technology, compared to for example German wikipedia. en:Rocket and en:Laser does not strike me as hughely important though.

Concerning fire and combustion - I think combustion is the broader term, which includes everything about fire - ignition, fuel, conditions, fire, flame, glowing, char, ash, heat and so on. Just because it is a ""chemical process"" doesn't mean it's only about chemistry, ""chemical process"" is a very broad term. English wikipedia has indeed chosen to include more content in the article en:Fire but I think this is erronous, the term ""fire"" refers more to the actual flame rather than the whole process.

I vote for Behavioral addiction. Drug abuse is a quite English-specific phrase, which is why the article about it has only two equivalents in other Wikipedias. Sure, substance dependence and behavioral addiction have none, but that's because of the recent split, I think. I feel that among those two, Behavioral addiction is broader (it also covers a part of Substance dependence which is why I agree that splitting them is silly), but I'll reconsider if someone puts out a better argument."

When we list more than one article about the same topic (e.g. philosophers, countries, languages, cities, works of art...), we don't just stick to the most important ones (e.g. bigger cities, most spoken languages): we try to cover that topic broadly. That's why you will find relatively small countries like Israel, relatively secondary languages as Esperanto and works of art which are not so popular as many others, but are maybe relevant as the most outstanding work of art of that kind or from that geographical area (yes, although ""hey, but we lack more important ones!""). --"

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2010	19	Qatar	0	RekishiEJ	09:40, 21 September 2010 (UTC)	"Per above suggestion, any consideration about adding Qatar now that the UAE has been taken out (and replaced with Dubai)? Possible reasons:
Another oil (and gas) rich state; adding in place of UAE would be like a neutraliser. Would also meet the argument of RekishiEJ, who said that UAE, a state rich in oil is critically important. For record, Qatar, apart from being rich in oil, additionally has the third-largest gas reserves in the world. I would have nominated Bahrain too, another Mid-East country rich in its resources, although am advocating Qatar as it is more larger and important. 
As pointed out, Qatar is also the second (or first) highest per-capita income country in the world. As said in the main article, ""Oil and gas have made Qatar the second highest per-capita income country – following Liechtenstein – and one of the world's fastest growing.""   
A small but important gulf state in its own right, Qatar is also regarded by many economists as an 'emerging Dubai.' Many important organisations such as the international news network Al Jazeera are Qatari. 
Qatar Airways is ranked among the top ten in the world and its Economy Class was named best in the world in 2009.
Qatar's capital city, Doha, is an important regional economic center, and has been the center of important occasions such as the 2006 Asian Games, (the Asian Games are Asia's Olympic-style sporting event).
Speaking in terms of sports, Qatar has made bids for events such as the 2016 Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.      
The conclusion is that Qatar emulates the UAE in many ways as an important gulf state. Don't get me wrong - I am displaying no special bias or favouritism towards Middle East topics (neither do I come from there) but on an independent look, I give this proposal second-thought and think that it would be a good candidate - and we could perhaps take out Kinshasa. 124.185.55.231 05:57, 21 September 2010 (UTC)

If we don't count in the Five Oceans and the water bodies on the borders of continents (i.e., Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Suez Canal), all continents happen to have five each, except for Oceania, which has only one (Great Barrier Reef).

 America: Amazon River, Caribbean Sea, Great Lakes, Mississippi River, Panama Canal

 Europe: Baltic Sea, Danube, North Sea, Rhine, Volga River

 Africa: Congo River, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria, Niger River, Nile

 Asia: Dead Sea, Ganges, Indus River, Lake Baikal, Yangtze River

The American waters are all very important and they are well-balanced. Better not to change.

As for Africa, Nile and Congo River are undoubtedly worthy of the place. But Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria, and Niger River? I'm still doubting.

As for Europe, Rhine is the shortest river in the whole list (111th in the world and 4th in Europe). But Rhine is quite important. I prefer not to remove it. Baltic Sea and North Sea, maybe we can remove one of them. No other single-continent seas are in the list.

As for Asia, maybe we can remove Dead Sea. It is a place of interest, but perhaps not a place of as much importance. Then maybe Ganges. It is quite important, but there are so many bigger Asian rivers that are not on the list, such as Mekong River, Amur River, and Euphrates.

So, my vote is Yellow River is definitely in, and one of the European seas or African lakes or Asian small waters is out. :) --"

The others look okay, they're fundamental concepts and in the Vital articles as well. But now that you mentioned it, I noticed another article from our list which should go: en:Length. That one is absolutely horrible and contains just a list in most Wikipedias. en:Length should be replaced by en:Matter, and instead of en:Wave we could have en:Vacuum in the list. --

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2011	10	 Changing the mathematics articles 	0	Ozob	13:26, 18 May 2011 (UTC)	"I would like to change the list of mathematics articles to the following:

 Mathematics
 Algebra
 Logarithm
 System of linear equations
 Arithmetic
 Coordinate system
 Differential and integral calculus
 Differential equation
 Equation
 Function (mathematics)
 Geometry
 Angle
 Area
 Pi
 Pythagorean theorem
 Inequality
 Infinity
 Mathematical proof
 Number
 Prime number
 Set theory
 Statistics
 Standard deviation
 Symmetry
 Trigonometry

This involves the following changes:
 Arithmetic, Geometry, and Number get bolded.
 Group theory is replaced by Symmetry. Group theory is a specific discipline within abstract algebra. An article on group theory is necessarily specialized. The essence of group theory, however, is symmetry: Groups (in the mathematical sense) were originally discovered as symmetry groups, and many of their most important applications can still be understood directly as the presence of symmetry in some sort of mathematical object.
 Add logarithm.  This is of great historical and practical interest.  Logarithms are used every day for measurements of sound, power, earthquakes, and a wide variety of other natural phenomena.
 Remove Axiom.  This has a lot of overlap with mathematical proof, truth, and logic, all of which are already on the list.
 Mathematical analysis is replaced by differential and integral calculus. This effectively undoes a change made last year (see this discussion), as on the English Wikipedia, differential and integral calculus is a redirect to calculus.  The problem with the outcome of that discussion is that in English, ""mathematical analysis"" refers to a broad area within mathematics, encompassing not only differential and integral calculus, but also aspects of Fourier theory, number theory, and differential geometry.  The list should link to the English article entitled ""calculus"", but to avoid confusion, the link should be titled ""differential and integral calculus"" since that refers unambiguously to the subject we are attempting to list.  (In many languages the name of this subject translates as ""infinitesimal calculus"", which would also be acceptable, but on the English Wikipedia, that article is currently about some historical aspects of calculus.)
 Remove numerical analysis.  Numerical analysis is about how to make accurate computations on computers. It's a specialized field which most people have no contact with; I'm a professional mathematician and I have no contact with it.
 Replace triangle, circle and square with angle, area, and Pythagorean theorem. The list is weighted heavily in favor of geometric shapes. Geometric shapes are a basic topic in geometry, but each geometric shape is not a new concept; they're all examples of the particular concept of shape. Angle and area are two fundamental concepts that don't appear anywhere on the list, and the Pythagorean theorem might be the most important theorem ever; it is at the heart of how we measure distance in the real world, and it is probably the only theorem that a layman might recall.
 Replace number theory by prime number.  Number theory is a broad field of study with a tremendous range of interesting but not always easy to understand topics.  When possible, I would prefer that the list contain more specific topics. Prime numbers are just that kind of topic: They can be approached using simple examples that anyone can grasp, and they are at the heart of number theory.
 Replace complex number by inequality.  Inequalities are a part of everyone's life: ""This pear costs more than that apple"", ""That will take an hour, but I only have twenty minutes"", ""This building is taller than that one"", etc.  Complex numbers are everywhere in physics and mathematics, but they don't connect to people's lives in the same way.
 Add standard deviation.  This is one of the most important topics in statistics; it's consistently the #2 viewed article on the English Wikipedia (after Einstein, who was actually a physicist).  Furthermore, it's also a bridge to other aspects of higher math: The standard deviation is actually an L2 norm (see en:Lp space), and L2 norms also represent important concepts like distance and energy.

There are many other articles that I would love to include but which I am not sure how to make space for (such as en:Pascal's triangle, en:Fibonacci number, en:Gödel's incompleteness theorems, en:Russell's paradox, en:Cantor's diagonal argument, en:Wave (maybe the physics list needs that one?), and en:Möbius strip).

The count appears to be won by ""infinitesimal calculus"", which has all the major European languages.  (However, someone actually fluent in all those languages would probably be able to make a better count.)
I think the right thing to do is to merge :en:Infinitesimal calculus into :en:Calculus, and then include ""Infinitesimal calculus"" on the list."

I don't believe the argument put forward in that thread. ""Mathematical analysis"" is a huge, huge field, but its original basis and most important tools are derivatives and integrals. The cornerstone of harmonic analysis is the :en:Fourier transform, which is an integral; harmonic analysis considers more general objects such as :en:integral transforms, but these too are defined by integrals. The earliest use of analysis in number theory was :en:Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which is an application of the Fourier transform (an integral). Analysis is everywhere in differential geometry because integrals and derivatives are everywhere in differential geometry. For example, the :en:Isoperimetric inequality is at heart a statement about integrals. :en:Hodge theory is a very powerful relation between shape and derivatives. Without derivatives and integrals, mathematical analysis would not exist.
6. If you can find an engineering topic to get rid of, then we can replace that by numerical analysis. It would be better there, because it's an obscure, tiny corner of mathematics. (Also, as far as I can tell, about half of numerical analysis is how to approximate integrals. So we can't include numerical analysis unless we include calculus. :-)
8. I disagree here, too. The study of prime numbers is not merely one subject among many in number theory. Primes are central to number theory in a way that nothing else is. Number-theoretic questions, even ones that appear to have nothing to do with prime numbers, are often solved by studying primes. For example, a large part of number theory is studying :en:Diophantine equations. ""Solving a Diophantine equation"" means finding all the possible integer solutions to that equation. :en:Fermat's Last Theorem is an example of this kind of problem, and solving it is equivalent to solving it when the exponent is prime. In fact, Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem required studying the behavior of elliptic curves modulo primes. Prime numbers hold a special place in number theory in the same way that integrals and derivatives hold a special place in mathematical analysis.
9. I disagree. Compare :en:Equation (which is quite short) to :en:Inequality (which is long and detailed). There is a lot to say about inequalities.
Of course, all the articles currently on the list are interesting, too. I would prefer to not remove any articles from the math section, but I do not think that is practical."

I was hoping that you would post a response to me, but so far you haven't.  I am particularly concerned at the loss of :en:Inequality.  Mathematical analysis and numerical analysis cannot be understood without inequalities, and there are many topics in geometry, number theory, and statistics that depend on inequalities.

I can't say which one is more important, I'm just saying that we don't need both articles together in the list. --

This is a traditional English term for mathanalysis. We respect traditions. What is differential and integral calculus? It is mathematical analysis. Neither theory of differential equations or differential geometry belong to mathematical analysis. They are related but separate fields of mathematics. Fourier series do belong to the mathematical analysis as a specific case of series.  --93.73.24.135 03:48, 3 June 2011 (UTC)
In my experience, in the English language and in professional mathematics more widely, ""calculus"" and ""infinitesimal calculus"" refer to the study of derivatives and integrals. ""Mathematical analysis"" is a wider field which is based on derivatives and integrals. Because it is impossible to understand mathematical analysis without understanding infinitesimal calculus, I believe that ""infinitesimal calculus"" is a more important article."

I think it's more useful to have articles about the fundamental ideas of mathematics -- analysis (incl. derivatives, integrals, differential equations, dynamical systems), algebra (incl. number theory), foundations (incl. logic, set theory, category theory), geometry (incl. topology) -- rather than about elementary concepts that happen to have some mathematical content.

The middle depends on the encyclopedia's target audience.  I could have proposed a more technical list above (with for example :en:Measure (mathematics) in place of :en:Area), but even though that would be appropriate for a mathematical encyclopedia, I do not think it would be appropriate for a general audience encyclopedia.

There are several articles on individual lakes, but none on lake, several on individual countries consisting solely of islands, but none on island. Also, there's one on rain forest, but not on the more basic concept of forest, one on city but not on settlement (and on migration, a major component of the ever-increasing importance of cities). I know that the last one is a bit hard to argue for, because city is probably much more often searched for, but as in other mentioned cases, I cannot imagine defining a city other than by ""large settlement"" (and it seems I'm not the only one doing so). Also, the non-settled lifestyle of nomad, a historically very important concept, isn't featured on the list. Interestingly, agriculture is on the list (and rightfully so), but not hunting. On the other hand, there are articles on both sea and ocean, but isn't the difference between them only one of definition, just like the one between island and continent? I'm not even sure these differences exist in every language, especially the ""smaller"" ones this list is addressed to. I know, it's a long list of proposed additions and a small one of proposed removals, but generally, I would argue for less specific objects and more basic concepts to be featured on the list, even if the latter ones are a bit more searched for, because one of the most important tasks an encyclopedia should fulfil is defining, while explaining can only be the following step. --"

I am pretty sure the audience for these articles can understand an article on ""rain forest"" without beforehand reading ""forest"". I would just make the decision purely on importance.

So, while I am basically in favor of more articles on basic geographical concepts, this was the only example where I found an included one to be a bit too redundant. The way I see it, it's not supposed to be about ""a sea"", but ""the sea"" as an ecosystem, a waterway, a legal or political term (""high seas""), and so on. This comprises oceans, bays and other bodies of saline water of various size, though to different extents. So, if you're wondering why the English article on the topic is so bad, it's not because such a concept is too ""basic"" to even write about it, but too abstract to be completely captured in an easy way. That's also why we have so many specific geographical objects listed here, while it took several attempts to finally include ""mountain"". In fact, many articles on specific geographical objects are bot-generated on small Wikipedias anyway, and while this still leaves the task of expanding the articles to the authors, it's not quite what this list is about. To sum it up: Geographical articles are considered to be about describing, not explaining – which, however, is a convention, not a necessity or fact. Seen that way, your concerns just echo the contraints caused by the non-equal structure of Wikipedia's authorship (which, btw, not only favor ""western"" topics, but also ""male"" ones).
Concerning ""forest"", I'd agree that ""rainforest"" is important enough for being listed seperately, but shouldn't all large ecozones be included in some way or another, not just ""rainforest"" and ""desert""? This is also a main factor of the importance of islands, which often feature very distinct assemblages of species, in contrast to the political and geological concept of a ""continent"". ""Lake"" is similar in that aspect, being some kind of a counterpart to ""island"". Concerning ""city"", however, you're definitely right. I shouldn't have brought that one up in the first place. --"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2011	12	 Franz Liszt 	0	Vladmirfish	01:13, 23 June 2011 (UTC)	Maybe Dvořák should be replaced with Liszt. Although Dvořák was an amazing composer, I feel that Liszt was more influential to music in general- after all, he more or less invented the piano recital and the masterclass. Perhaps, although Chopin is an incredible composer, Liszt could replace him becuase they both wrote in similar styles. The Composers and musicians list is packed full, so I understand if there isn't room.

Bob Marley's contribution to sub-saharan African music (not just reggae) is immense, as is his influence on contemporary music world-wide. He is up there with The Beatles.

Aquinas, Thomas - Christian
Augustine of Hippo - Christian
Buddha  - Buddhism 
Ghazali - Muslim
Jesus - Christian, Muslim
Luther, Martin - Christian
Moses - Jewish, Christian, Muslim
Muhammad - Muslim
Paul the Apostle - Christian

Out of ten figures, 8 have to do with Christianity, either in combination or singly. That is severely unbalanced.

I would take out:
Paul the Apostle
Aquinas, Thomas 
Augustine of Hippo  

Because they are singly important to Christianity. So is Martin Luther, but the Reformation was a world-changing event that makes him a world figure - and the reformation itself had peripheral effects on other religions, like Judaism and Islam.

As a replacement, I would put:

Zoroaster - founder of the first monotheistic religion.
Confucius - founder of the first non-theist religious philosophy.
I cannot decide whom, but a Hindu religious figure (perhaps some expert can comment)

This would balance the list. As it stands, it is Christian propaganda, not a world overview of religious biographies.--"

As a side note, Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Islam are just other families in the greater christian family, not really distinct religions, so of those ten, nine have something to do with Christianity.  Also, I would not take out Paul because there are religions that worship him, not Jesus, as the son of Jehovah.  Nor would I take out Augustine of Hippo if I could avoid it, as he is important to philosophy as well as religion - his works, stripped of religious context, set out such important ideas as free will and just war, and wrote important early thought on the nature of time, thought, language, and memory.  He could be taken out, though - it seems a bit odd to me that we have Augustine of Hippo, but not the Bible.  As to Hinduism, there are few central religious figures as there are on the judeochristian tradition, and far too many gods - it's old like Shinto, as polysyncretic, dates back before modern written record, and does not have a set ""canon"" to refer to; hinduism is not a ""given"" religion as in the Abrahamic or Buddhist traditions, but a ""grown"" religion.  If any more articles need to be added for Hinduism, I think we could start with :en:Trimurti (replacing the specific Shiva) and then add :en:Varna (their infamous caste system which has influenced culture, government, and society in the region for millenia and to this day).
Also, I do not support adding Confucius, because anything he did for the purposes of the top 1,000 is sufficiently covered by Confucianism."

I cannot understate this: someone from this list needs to go to place him here. Zoroastrism was the first prophetic and evangelical religion, and at its height was practiced more than any religion in the world. It might be a historic artifact now, practiced by a few hundred thousand, but its influence on Abrahamic religions cannot be understated, as well as being the definitive form of monotheistic worship (even if really duotheistic). This is an extremely important figure in providing a comprehensive view of religious biography.--"

I would like to suggest Menstruation, to go under Reproduction in the Biological Processes section.

 Menstruation is a phenomenon that just over half our target audience of ""everyone"" will be, currently is, or once was undergoing.
 It forms a natural link to critical medical articles, such Puberty, Menopause, the organs of the female Reproductive system, and other topics related to Reproduction.
 Its influence on human culture has done a lot to shape the gender roles into what they were historically, making cultural and historical references a natural lead into several topics on Feminism, Sex, Mythology, various religions, and the cultures and values of various nations.

Maybe I'm biased, but growing up, I knew a lot of girls who were fed complete fiddle-faddle about their anatomy.  I think it's important not only to English-speaking girls, but every girl in the world, to have a source of complete and factual information about their bodies.

I'm going to bring it up again, because really, it's true that Algeria and Cuba aren't all that important, and I'm going to suggest ditching the current list and picking 40 countries from scratch.
  
Here's my suggestion.  The first 25-27 countries I feel are fairly objective criterion:

 1. The G8 + BRICs = 11 (Russia's in both).  These also happen to be the 11 countries with the highest GDP. 2. Countries that are in three of the following: Next Eleven, EAGLEs or Eagles' Nest, Developing 8, newly industrialized countries and in the top 40 by GDP or purchasing power parity. 3. Countries which are will be in the top 10 for population by 2050, according to the UN. . USA
 China
 Japan
 Germany
 France
 UK
 Brazil
 Italy
 India
 Canada
 Russia Mexico
 South Korea
 Indonesia
 Turkey
 Iran
 Thailand
 South Africa
 Egypt
 Pakistan
 Malaysia *see below
 Nigeria
 Philippines
 Vietnam Bangladesh (7) *see below
 Ethiopia (9)
 Democratic Republic of the Congo (10) 11 countries  13 countries  3 countries

This gives a fairly nice group of 27 countries,  though I might suggest not including Malaysia and Bangladesh, because South and Southeast Asia are already well-represented by even more important countries.
This would give us 25 countries.  After that, it becomes arbitrary, but I would suggest first:

4. The two important parts of the UN geoscheme not represented (I had Oceania, but realized that's also a continent).
 Central Asia
 Caribbean

Now up to 27 or 29 countries select from 11-13 from the remainder (asterisks indicate my picks)

 5. Fairly populous countries, which are also regional powers and played a key role in the development of human civilization.  6. Sundry regional powers  7. Biologically megadiverse countries, from geographic areas that aren't well represented in the above  8. Remaining arbitrary countries that are kind of interesting and important, but part of well-represented regions in the above list Iraq
 Peru *
 Colombia * Australia *
 Israel *
 Kenya *
 New Zealand
 Poland *
 Spain *
 Saudi Arabia * Madagascar *
 Papua New Guinea * Argentina
 Chile
 Finland (because of the economic miracle)

Unlike New York or LA, or even a number of smaller cities, such as Boston, DC is only internationally notable by being the capital of a powerful country, and not as a city in its own right.  And while Singapore isn't especially notable as a country, as a city it's one of the most important in the world. --

That seems like an awfully arbitrary number to me, and it isn't explained anywhere how it was chosen.As for the list, the top one seems okay, although I'm a bit unhappy with Ethiopia (Kenya seems like a better choice to me). As for the others, Australia, Spain, Saudi Arabia and probably Switzerland seem like good additional choices to me.As for Singapore, be wary: the city of Singapore was officially dissolved in 1965, so including it as a city makes little sense. --
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2011	34	 Alternative Country Proposal 	3	Quintucket	01:32, 22 December 2011 (UTC)	"40 countries is the number we already have.  I don't think that 40 out of 1000 is overmuch.  There's more than that in the top 1000 most visited. (I stopped counting when I got to 41.)  Obviously the English Wikipedia article isn't a great example, but you can try other languages, and skimming quickly see that the numbers of countries appear to be similar, though many of the particular countries vary. (Brits and Americans care about Afghanistan. Spanish speakers don't.)

I agree that we should add Kenya (see above), but I think we should include Ethiopia.  It's one of the most important countries in the history of human civilization, the only African country that remained independent, second most populous African country (and 18th most populous in the world today; it would be the only country in the top twenty we excluded), and center of pan-Africanism.

Also, I notice, surprisingly that Nepal seems to be quite popular in a number of Wikis, in the top thousand in every one I checked except Georgian, top 500 for most (and as high as 8 on the Arabic WP).   Same for most European countries, which suggests we might want to increase their representation.  Europe makes sense, since most people everywhere know multiple people who live there or have lived there, but the enduring popularity of Nepal (it seems to be consistent, I tried multiple months and years on several Wikis) baffles me.  And why is Georgian the one exception? (I tried Spanish, Turkish, Uzbek, Arabic, Indonesian, Javanese, Komi, Nahuatl, Greenlandic, Swahili, Yoruba, and Korean.)

And you're absolutely right that we can't expect people to start with 40 articles; we will have to choose a new set of vital articles.  Suggestions?

And the bit about Singapore is interesting, thanks.  Though I feel like we can still treat it as a city for our purposes.  How do you feel about my evaluation of DC?  Maybe I should start a separate section in the event that we remove it from the countries. --"

That's probably too little for our purposes, though, so a middle ground (30? 35?) should be appropriate.As for European countries, you need to watch out: from your European standpoint, it makes sense to include many European countries. However, for a user from Africa or Asia who is trying to improve his or her Wikipedia, he or she might find it appropriate that the list is so centered on a region considered ""foreign"" to them, and that doesn't have the same importance to them as it does for us. It's important that some kind of balance is maintained, even if it may be a bit difficult for us.As for the cities, that would probably need to be discussed separately, although I agree that DC isn't really worth including.

Most of the changes that happen here often look like changes for the sake of changing so its preferable in some cases to only change when there are enough changes to justify a change.

The article seems to be telling contributors to various Wikipedias in various languages that they should prioritise articles on the listed subjects - but in many sections the subjects listed clearly reflect culture, worldviews and intellectual traditions of a specifically western tradition (for want of a more specific term). This is most obvious in the biography section, especially in the arts biographies (actors... artists... authors... composers) but is evident in many of the sections. So, for example, the simplified chinese language wiki should prioritise, within it's top 1000 articles, an article on e.g. Sarah Bernhardt?

Thanks for the prompt response. I'm somewhat relieved to see that these issues have been discussed before, and find myself in broad agreement with the 'Serious Eurocentrism' concern raised by user Aghniyya, and subsequent discussion.   At this stage I will make some general suggestion on possible approaches to the list that may go some way to reducing bias, and leave specific figures/subjects out of the discussion for the time being:

- The list ought to strive to reflect, in accurate proportions, the intellectual, symbolic and cultural traditions of the balance of peoples that constitute the human family today. Most importantly, there are many subjects and domains of activity and practice that simply stem from common human experience, sharing the planet, and common issues and challenges we face. These should take up the greater share of the list. The sections on the specific cultural traditions of certain societies should in fact be minimized, and to the extent that a techno-scientific worldview is also largely the product of western culture, the science subjects should not over-dominate (more on this below):

- History and Geography should be most prominent. The history of nations/civilization should not focus too much on individual figures, but rather on chronologies. It should also be cautious to counter the 'history is written by the victors' syndrome, so include the perspectives of the oppressed as well as the dominant. Even where this is ugly. Think Howard Zinn. There should be much more on the history of important transitions in universal material culture such as farming and food. The establishment of these and the variety of how they are practised should be elaborated and central, as well as other material realities. But it should be balanced and not techno-progressive - for example, forager societies must be noted. The lives of the vast majority of the world's people are very much dominated and orientated towards material concerns and security, and to the extent that Wikis can contextualize such concerns, and serve as a repository for knowledge and practice in these matters, this is surely a crucially valuable role. In the same spirit, earth sciences, and information on e.g. healthy soils, biodiversity and pollution issues should play a prominent role in this list.

- There is far too much material on the sciences and mathematics. This is way beyond the concerns of most people in most societies. Around half the world's population are farmers. Why do we need articles on Capacitor, Inductor, Transistor, Diode, Resistor, Transformer? This is a good example of the techno-scientific bias of this list. The health and anatomy section reflects only the western medicine tradition, and it's interventionist, chemical practices, which is very different from e.g. the traditional chinese system, and indian traditions, with their whole-body, dietary practices etc. The technology section's articles on clothing / agriculture technologies and basic engineering are pitching at the right level given most people's concerns. The weapons section is just odd.

- There is and should remain plenty of material on the variety worldviews, social organization and political systems, and also some reflection on the psychological and symbolic processes by which these get propagated, in order to relativize these variations somewhat, and universalize the general human experience with these things. But the analytic aspect should be not too scientific, since this may include bias. E.g. if there are to be psychology articles, they should avoid an exclusively western perspective - which is difficult given the history of the discipline. The philosophy section should be redone in much more general terms, reflecting different traditions. E.g. dialectic is not a philosophical tradition in Chinese culture nor society; all the categories here reflect purely the western tradition.

- The music section is totally dominated by western traditions - I don't see anything on e.g. Chinese or Indian traditional styles or instruments in there. The article on 'opera' explicitly only treats the European tradition. That's very poor.

- I could go on and on, but I won't. In summary - remove the techno-scientific progressive bias. Remove the dominance of western categories from all the general subjects (health, medicine, philosophy...etc). Remove most of the biographies, and minimize the cult of personality. Go look at the most popular articles on Chinese, Indian and other wikis. Don't suggest that THEY SHOULD TREAT THE SUBJECTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WIKI AS THE MODEL TO BE EMULATED - instead, go look at their intellectual traditions, their narratives, and make the English language wiki reflect something of their worldview and culture!"

I am not going to make specific suggestions for articles right now, although I will be happy to make specific suggestions in future edits. My suggestion is to first remove much of the western content from the list, because it sends the wrong message, and people are presumably spending valuable time translating this stuff.
Western traditions/figures should only take a proportional (vis population) fraction of the list. This might be 10%~20%. The list can then be reconstituted with suitable fractions from e.g. Chinese (~20%), Indian ~17%, African ~17%, Middle Eastern (10~20% ?)and other societies and traditions (Japanese, Polynesian, Innuit, Native North, Central and South American. These could be at some meta-scale (e.g. 'Japan' as a whole), or preferably some specific cultural tradition within the larger nation (e.g. the Ainu culture within Japan).
To get ideas about what content to include from non-western cultures, either ask colleagues on other wikis to contribute suggestions, or go to the other wikis and see what e.g. which figures their popular historical biographies are on, what works of literature are considered influential, which events are focused upon in their history pages... etc."

You are justifying cultural imperialism by making reference to... cultural imperialism! Surely the essence of the whole wiki project is the converse - an attempt to get beyond such historical domination of the knowledge and world-view of the many by the few, not to replicate this domination. It is as if the liberation were intended only to democratize knowledge within the English language culture, but to maintain a non-democratic, top-down, imperialist project in the inter-cultural realm.

For example, why should the simplified Chinese language wiki prioritise, within it's top 1000 articles, an article on e.g. Muhammad Iqbal? It's easy to say we should ask other language editors, but that won't solve the main problem: what criteria should we use for inclusion? The way you suggest, this list would end up as a mashup of local heroes that almost nobody could learn anything from, because their contributions were too culture-specific. You may say that this is true for the current version of the list (which you are saying), but your solution contributes nothing, except the additional problem of arguments about whose local hero is more worthy of inclusion, which would inevitably arise.
 The way I see it, the only reasonable solution would be to leave out culture-specific terms as much as possible and include those that are really globally important. I agree with you that we should focus on crucial ideas and concepts rather than people or events, which would involve seriously reducing the number of biographies. In this light, focus on techno-progressivistic terms is necessary (although trimming may be needed in a couple of spots). Those are the concepts that are transforming the whole planetary society right now, and cannot be simply waved away as ""western"", as Almafeta pointed out below. They made Wikipedia possible and even a farmer will benefit from learning how. It is in my opinion not biased to exclude, say, :en:Hunter-gatherer, even though it was a key period in development of modern society; this type of society, while some may still exist, is not sustainable today. However, we should look for underlying key innovations that made such transitions possible and are still relevant - concepts as :en:Trade, :en:Division of labour etc.
 The same idea is behind prioritizing science-based medicine over local systems of healing knowledge embedded in local mythology and tradition. What ""western"" medicine does, is to take elements of those systems that work, try to find out why they work and incorporate the findings. Sure, sometimes the way this is done can be labeled as exploitative which is deserving of all condemnation, but in general, this approach has contributed a lot to doubling the human lifespan in past 100 years. What other medicinal system can make a claim that even begins to compare? 
 As for your accusations of imperialistic tendencies, this part of the discussion is a dead end. I have but one quote in reply: ""Wikipedia is a mirror, not the lamp."" —"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2012	5	 ethnocentrism and cultural imperialism 	8	Almafeta	11:51, 13 February 2012 (UTC)	"A few comments.
First, Wikipedia is by its nature a 'techno-scientific progressive' project; it's a project on the Internet to be read by people who are on the Internet.  The idea that technology and science are just 'tools of western imperialism' is silly.  In today's world, there is no 'eastern science' or 'western science'; there is no 'eastern technology' nor 'western technology'; and culture is eagerly following where the science and technology has led.
Second, there is a de facto rule in this list mandating globalization; at least one person per continent has been included in each major area, even if there are more globally influential people.  Frida Khalo is in but Donatello is out, for example, on the sole virtue that Frida Khalo is from North America, Donatello is from Europe, and Europe has 'enough people' - even though if you ask any thousand people anywhere in the world, hundreds will have heard of Donatello while tens will have heard of Frida Khalo.  We've already gone through several cycles where all European contributions to global culture have been decimated to make room, and the entirety of American contributions to global culture is usually reserved for the North American or South American slot in the list; if you were to go any farther, you might as well ban any European or American from appearing in the list.
Third, the idea that folk medicine should be treated with the same respect as actual medicine is ridiculous; :en:Folk medicine as an entire field might merit one article in the expanded list of vital articles, but it has no place in the core 1000.  The top 1000 has no room for antiscientific topics - whether eastern or western; no eastern accupuncture and no western homeopathy, no eastern Reiki and no western humors.
Finally, the English wiki is not the model to be emulated because it's western.  It's the model to emulate because it has the most active community, the most rigorous standards for content and citation, and the highest standards for quality.  Languages don't care about borders - all language wikis can be read and edited from anywhere in the world, and nowhere is this more true than in the global community for our oldest wiki, English.
Sorry to come down so hard on you."

First, Don't confuse the medium with the message. Also note the connection of this list with related projects whose goal is to create an offline/stand alone version of wikipedia, and printed versions (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Core_topics); wikipedia is not simply 'a project on the internet to be read by people on the internet'. Even if it were, this would not justify the pushing of a techno-scientific cultural perspective. Your claim that there is no distinction between western and eastern science is historically inaccurate. There are distinctions between the traditions, most clearly in medicine. I agree there is convergence, and that western science is replacing eastern science in many areas. An important question is how and why this is happening. There is a significant co-option of e.g. tradition Indian medicine practices by western pharmaceutical firms, very often in a manner which exploits and seeks to dominate those Indian traditions (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization_of_indigenous_knowledge), and is being pushed by western institutions like the WTO. Are you aware of any of this?
Second, The problem is that we are claiming that other wikis should prioritize the content of this list. In other words we are telling people in other cultures what and how to think. This is dangerous ground, and I would argue potentially goes against the whole idea of the wiki project. If it is to be done at all, it must reflect a balanced perspective that respects the diversity of cultures around the world, not just another form of imperialism. The 'at least one person from each continent': nice idea, but many of the lists do not follow it. And even if they were to, it would still allow 80-90% of the content to reflect western influences/traditions.
Third, see point one
Finally, You are confusing the medium with the message again. It's great that the English language wiki is so well maintained and structured, with citation/quality standards etc. Here we are talking about the content of wikipedias. This List of articles every Wikipedia should have is essentially saying that the wikis of other cultures (languages) ought to prioritize a set of knowledge content and a world-view that we set out here. It is thus asserting the imposition of a set of perspectives - and is thus a form of cultural imperialism, and is dangerous. If it were the imposition of some kind of balanced multi-cultural perspectives (that I have been arguing it must strive for if it is to exists at all), there might conceivably be arguments that the positives could outweigh the negatives. But in terms of its current content, it is multicultural only to a negligible extent. In calling for the imposition of a specific cultural perspective on other cultures, it joins other historical forms of cultural imperialism. Is this really what the wikipedia movement is all about? I'd like to know whether Jimmy and other key contributors to the wiki project agree with the goals of this list.

Tetraktys, it might be useful if at each name below you gave a specific trade-off (for example, not just ""remove Antonín Dvořák"" but rather ""remove him and replace with Kandinsky,"" or whatever);  then we can consider each one individually.

As a composer, he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 the music was discovered and championed by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.

his work, however important, is transitional. he didn't create anything new.

leader of the Second Viennese School... Schoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, is among the major landmarks of 20th-century musical thought; at least three generations of composers in the European and American traditions have consciously extended his thinking or, in some cases, passionately reacted against it.... Schoenberg was widely known early in his career for his success in simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify pioneering innovations in atonality that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, a widely influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation, and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.... Schoenberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential teacher of composition; his students included Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Hanns Eisler, Egon Wellesz, and later John Cage, Lou Harrison, Earl Kim, Leon Kirchner, and many other prominent musicians. Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method, and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in avant-garde musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many of the 20th century's significant musicologists and critics, including Theodor Adorno, Charles Rosen, and Carl Dahlhaus. His thought also had a considerable influence on the pianists Rudolf Serkin, Artur Schnabel, and Eduard Steuermann, and, later, Glenn Gould."

Then I'll describe my thoughts. This list currently has ""alphabet"", which, strictly speaking, excludes Chinese and Japanese characters, for instance. As a Japanese, I feel the current state of the list is imcomplete or biased. However cunsuming other 2 slots by adding ""logography"" and ""syllabary"" is probably not acceptable since many people are trying hard to add articles about other topics. ""Writing system"" is a generic concept that covers segmental, logographic and syllabic systems. So replacing ""alphabet"" with ""writing system"" is my first priority. ""Writing"" covers similar topics but I think ""writing"" is too vague, overlaps both ""writing system"", ""literacy"" and ""literarure"", and difficult to give a clear direction so not appropriate as target to develop into big article. Besides, en:writing system has 92 interlanguage links while en:writing has 84, so I guess the former is more popular article. Adding ""writing system"" makes ""writing"" somewhat redundant and therefore remove it. This is my second priority. Those series of changes give us one extra slot.

For reasons not far from those adduced by Fryed-peach, adding :en:Writing system would eliminate the need to have separate articles on Arabic alphabet, Chinese characters, Cyrillic script, Greek alphabet, and Hangul. Deleting those articles would free up five slots. What topics would best fill them? Or do people think it useful to retain these five supremely favored examples of writing systems? And then how is the absence of unfavored ones (such as Devanagari, Japanese writing system, Mayan script, etc.) explained? They're just not very interesting or important? or what? The first order of exemplification would be, not the systems of specific languages, but general topics: Abjad, Abugida, Alphabet, Logogram, and Syllabary. Hey, that's five right there! But we already have Alphabet, so the fifth linguistics-related topic could be Morpheme.

I support including Writing system and Translation, and removing the six specific writing systems.  To fill the five slots, Abjad, Abugida, Logogram and Syllabary sound too much technical, while they are (supposedly) covered by the general article for writing systems.  I like Morpheme better. Calligraphy is already covered in this list. I wouldn't add Undeciphered writing systems because it could be a subtopic of writing system (although it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the English article). Other worthwhile candidates might be some linguists such as Pāṇini and Ferdinand de Saussure. I would also add International Phonetic Alphabet and Dictionary (or Lexicography) as another linguistic-related topic, which has a wide coverage in a number of languages already. --"

Note that most projects have a rather (or extremely) small community of editors dedicated to create content, and while this list is useful, the 1000 subjects listed here are but a drop in the ocean. Many editors will focus on local or their background-specific subjects instead of general ones, or are simply unaware of this list.

If you look at is as plants (there are no specific plants in the list) more interesting plants could be thought of. On the other hand there is the factor it plays in live.

I believe that in all these languages and several others people would talk about the sea when looking from land for example at the Atlantic even if it is technically an ocean. Introduction to many articles about the sea (I checked also Italian and Spanish) includes two definitions of the term sea, either as distinct from ocean, or as including the total body if saline waters of the earth. Notice also iw-links from the article Seawater, which almost all have as an element the equivalent of the word sea, even if it obviously includes the water of the oceans. Finally the fact that almost all languages have a word for ocean directly derived from the greek word, while words for sea seem to be local, shows that the latter is a notion which is important in many different cultures, while the former is rather som technical distinction. --"

Perhaps every Wikipedia should have an article on Ancient Greek historiography, thus including both Herodotus and Thucydides as well as other very important figures (e.g. Xenophon and Polybius).

 I agree with adding Noether, who is higher in priority than Hilbert or Hertz, comparable to Riemann, Bohr, and Cauchy; Gibbs and Boltzmann are also important.  But the equivalence between symmetries and conservation laws is very deep and essential to 20th c. physics.  Also, Avicenna does not really belong as a scientist -- he's much more of a philosopher.  A better choice for a scientist would be Alhacen, who really was responsible in a certain decisive way for ""reasoning from experiment.""
 Huh? Noether should be higher in priority than David Hilbert? David Hilbert was certainly much more influential. Hilbert developed fundamental aspects of the theory of ideals (later Noether worked in this area, too). He was probably the most influential formalist, and formalism significantly influenced all areas of mathematics and even the conception of what mathematics are. He developed an axiomatisation of euclidean geometry and a calculus for first-order logic. In 1915 he formulated General Relativity using variational calculus (Noether also worked on variational calculus). Numerous of his 23 problems had significant impact on the roads of research in the next decades. --"

 David Hilbert should replace Fourier (he is only well-known because Fourier transform is named after him, but even for the Fourier series he only played some role). Resons were given above.
 John von Neumann (János Neumann Margittai) should replace Faraday (very redundant to Maxwell), I quote the Wikipedia article: “He made major contributions to a vast number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and fluid dynamics), economics (game theory), computer science (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.” That way we would get a second person related to fundamental aspects of computing (additionally to Alan Turing), a great mathematician and a person with important contributions to physical fields which are not yet well covered (he gave quantum mechanics a precise mathematical meaning, he was important in the development of statistical physics). --"

He is the internationally most known Scandinavian in this category (no Scandinavian author or playwright is included). There is no doubt Ibsen is vastly more well-known than eg.

Merely being a recipient of that prize doesn't establish notability on par with Shakespeare. The prize to García Márquez was also poorly received by critics, because he is not considered a that great author, and the Mahfouz guy seems just obscure.

Moreover, why remove Mahfouz simply because you've never heard of him?  Perhaps Mark Twain should be removed instead, or some other author?  Finally, some of us strongly prefer that changes happen earlier in the month, since this list drives the List of Wikipedias by sample of articles scoring.  I'm going to revert the change for now.  When there's general agreement about whether to add Ibsen, and which author should go out to make space for him, then the change can happen.

I don't consider him relatively obscure just because I've never heard of him, but primarily because his (rather short) English Wikipedia biography doesn't establish or indicate any notability beyond that of other less well-known Nobel Prize in Literature laureates. Various database searches seem to support this, for example Henrik Ibsen gives 1 480 000 results in Google Books compared to 72 000 for Mahfouz. I think Mahfouz is the least notable person currently included in the list, as indicated by Wikipedia biography and searches in various databases.

At the very least, coverage in the English Wikipedia is a good indication of the subject's relative importance, i.e. the article doesn't contain anything that indicates or demonstrates that he is among the world's most iconic and well-known 31 authors, playwrights and poets, which necessarily has to be a very selective list.

Most of its entries are, and invariably have to be, very arbitrary; different persons want to know different things, and the realm of knowledge is infinite.

We might argue about what topics are universally important and what are not, and seek to fit the list into the number of exactly a thousand articles (although even the distribution of material among articles depends on the language to use, and some words, especially very common ones, like ""mind"" or ""man"", have no direct translation to some languages that use other words to break down and present the concept, which words, in their turn, have no translation to English), and speak, and try to persuade, but the arguments to make always depend on the culture and language, and so, argumentation lacks its point unless the language and the culture are known; argumentation in favor of one topic to exclude another usually has to be vague.

I think that a group of Wikipedians who create a new Wikipedia know a lot better what their Wikipedia should have at its beginnings than we do here; and then expansion goes in a natural process as the new Wikipedia evolves: people who speak the language of the new Wikipedia demand knowledge and write articles on topics that interest them. So, I guess it's very amusing to discuss what titles should be included in the list and what titles they should replace, but such discussion has no use. Except, well, the result has interesting informations on its own; but better still, these informations could be presented in other places, like ""List of the most influental Chinese people throughout the history of China"" or ""List of influental mathematicians"". ;-) – 89.110.10.193 01:12, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

Your doubt is noted, although I'm not sure what did you want to achieve by expressing it. As explained in the introduction, some language projects are quite stagnant, so obviously their communities aren't so sure on how to commence this ""natural growth"". This list is therefore intended as a suggestion (although its title may be worded a bit too harsh) which, according to statistics, many people across the world do use. Its entries, in general, are universally important, or nearly so (at least in classing encyclopedic sense), being of course also subject to compromise and tweaking - as every other Wikimedia page. They are also the subjects on which many sources exist, so it's generally easier to write about them, therefore stimulating growth by the virtue of red links to non-existing related articles. Everybody is of course free to write about anything they want, and local Wikipedias also have their local lists. Again, I'm not sure what you wanted to achieve by the above message, except maybe implying own superiority with snarky comments about you being amused by our activity (which is not exactly relevant). If you don't consider this list useful, you're free to ignore it, you know? —"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2013	9	 Useful? 	1	Yerpo	18:01, 14 February 2013 (UTC)	" ""Its entries, in general, are universally important"": Well, the list is only as good as it is structured. In sections where it is structured, it is indeed a guideline: it is easy to use only the structure, and revise the details to achieve a good ""classically encyclopaedic"" result. The list is a continuous problem in the sections that are not structured and constitute nothing more than a sublist: one country, city, person, language, or river is just as good as every other one to make up an article, and it's useless to discuss candidatures. So, the basic structure had been laid out early (it is not as hard, but does indeed require a work), and since then, the discussions proceed mostly on: 1] candidatures, 2] some ""basic concepts"" (I'm having difficulties imagining a person who would look up in a newly created Wikipedia who is a man or a woman). Such discussions are interesting for themselves when they concern candidatures (especially people, and especially if the discutant makes real arguments about the person's life and achievements), and not quite so when they concern ""basic concepts"" (because the arguments for their importance are usually self-evident and directly follow from the structure of coverage), but they do not achieve any goal. Informations are interesting, their exchange is nice, but they get lost here.

 So, to reiterate the conclusion: in fact the compromise is not needed, because real Wikipediae do not contain compromises, but real articles; all is needed is structure; it is the structure that may be ""universally important"", not the entries. An alternative is a list of articles that are, true, important, with the exception that they are not generically important in the academical sense, but ""very likely"" important if premised that a newly created Wikipedia follows a specific goal to be guessed...

 one country, city, person, language, or river is just as good as every other one to make up an article: For example, I don't think that being more influental than others is indeed the criterion; there are lots of criteria for different persons to make choices of those kinds. – 91.122.87.175 18:27, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

Controversial choice of Dvorak, however Berlioz is not that important IMVHO. However, what really bugs me is:
 the presence (in bold!) of Richard Wagner, who being honest is a rather second-tier, flashy composer
 a removal of Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, one of the most prominent figures of romantism in music, a master of choral romantic music, a founder of Bach
 an ommission of Palestrina, a great example of a pre-classical music.
My proposal is:
Remove Vysotsky and Wagner. Really, not that importance, especially Vysotsky.
Add :en:Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and :en:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina
Make Chopin bold.

Then we change existing links of the form Homer to Homer, perhaps adding English: Homer Latin:  Homerus, or whatever other versions it would be most useful to link to.  (Realistically probably not Latin!  I'd suggest Catalan, since that WP is very good on the 1000 Pages, and one or two widely-spoken languages.)  This is very easy to do with a program;  I've done something similar already (see this table for example).  What we do need is to verify that the program that makes the List of Wikipedias by sample of articles will be able to adjust!

Personally, I think that the item d:Q240 should be on this list, but people have been moving interwikis around those three items and creating confusion. I fail to see the benefit of having d:Q9005 at all. —"

You can see that in the similar case of Angkor Wat is in the list but not Angkor. Interesting that the broad article in the cases of Giza Necropolis and Angkor is the one that is the World Heritage site so there is an argument to include that one instead. In looking at just this pyramid issue, I see people always having the Necropolis article as at least a list of the structures. And then either having an article about the main pyramids or an article about each pyramid. But if a wiki has the necropolis article and the individual pyramids (ie. english wp) then selecting that 'Giza Pyramids' for this list is forcing them to create article just to fulfill this list. We should just have either choice as an option. --MarsRover 20:07, 31 May 2013 (UTC)
 I find it interesting to note that initially, before the list was switched to Wikidata items, the corresponding entry was called ""Giza pyramid complex"", but linked to Giza Necropolis - I think mostly because of the fact that the two notions were not separated in terms of interwikis. Now that they are distinguished from each other, it would be natural to associate this entry with the pyramids, and not the necropolis. --"

Indian classical Music is an integral part of World Music. And Tansen is the greatest legend in it. He lived 400 years before my birth so I am not arguing for any COI reason.

We have only 21 composers and musicians, and in the world are more than 200 countries, we can't include composers of all this countries.

Why are logarithms bad? The logarithm is just an unimportant numeric operation, it is not even a particularly important one (addition and multiplication are much more important—and the logarithm is certainly not more important than powers and roots). Topology is a fundamental subfield of mathematics, like algebra, it is used everywhere in modern mathematics—it can bee seen as a counterpart to algebra: Algebra deals with operations/formulas in an abstract sense, topology deals with continuity/shapes in an abstract sense. --

But topology is more important.  I like the idea of adding Gödel’s theorems somewhere but I'd keep number theory;  perhaps this could replace the Pythagorean theorem?

I retract my suggestion to remove number theory. Number theory has a long history and is obviously more important than for example the Pythagorean theorem. I am unsure about the Pythagorean theorem, it is not particularly important, there are many theorems in elementary geometry, but it is especially popular among laymen. Let me describe the geometry articles in the list (I think there are too many geometry-related entries): “Area” and “symmetry” are quite general concepts in geometry with generalisations which are essential even in modern mathematics. Pi and the Pythagorean theorem are particularly popular (my subjective view, maybe it is not a universal phenomenon but biased: laymen regard π as “the” (interesting) number and the Pythagorean theorem as “the” theorem). There are also “angle” and “trigonometry”. I think at least one of them should leave the list. Both are closely related (“angle”: a fundamental geometric figure; “trigonometry”: study of another fundamental geometric figure, namely triangles, angles are particularly important here). Since trigonometry needs angles I suggest to replace trigonometry by Gödel’s theorems.
Another objection: Why is there “area” – why do we emphasize the two-dimensional case? “Length” or “volume” would work as-well. I favour to have such a link, since such notions of “size” are essential in mathematics, even historically. But it is bad to choose arbitrarily the two-dimensional case. Is there any idea how to choose an article? (and I do not think that “measure theory” would be a good idea, that is a modern, abstract subject, the general idea of “size” does not depend on it) --"

Symmetry is important beyond mathematics (e.g. in visual arts) so I'd keep that.  For me, what matters about the Pythagorean theorem is Fermat/Wiles;  neither the Pythagorean theorem nor ""Fermat's Last Theorem"" is all that important on its own, but the idea of trying to generalize this simple, ancient fact about triangles, and the fact that it took 400 years to prove that the obvious conjecture is in fact true, is a nice story about how mathematics really works.  Although the Wiles proof is not at all accessible to non-specialists, the theorems and the history are -- so I'd keep this.  In short, I agree with you about adding topology and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems;  I would drop area and angle."

Area is still a candidate to get replaced. Maybe volume is more appropriate?
Do you argue for adding FLT? Of course it is famous, but I do not think it is important enough. What is about the Poincaré conjecture? Riemann hypothesis? Shanuel conjecture? Maybe Langlands program?

I have just found this interesting list about the most important articles of the Wikipedia project. I noticed the presence of the article ""anime"" (in other words, japanese animation). I propose the addition of the article ""manga"" to this list, since

 it is an important part of the Japanese culture and literature
 it is the main influence of anime
 it has strong historical roots
 it is well-known around the world

Tell me what you think about it. Have a very good day!"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2013	31	 Manga 	1	Yerpo	17:00, 1 August 2013 (UTC)	I believe anime is more influential globally, so it's a better representation of the modern Japanese culture. Manga just seems redundant if you look at it broadly. In any case, some entry would need to be removed to make place and I don't see anything so unimportant to justify removing in favour of having two closely related terms in this list. —

So lets consider the triangle Arthropods - Insects - Molluscs. Molluscs are important as food source (e.g. clams), luxury materials source (e.g. pearles), pathogens (e.g. shistosoma) and popular as spectacular animals (octopuses, calmars, tridacnas). Separately arthropods and insects are very important, but does their mutual presence on the list outweights the importance of molluscs? Overall, currently on the list there 6 articles from the arthropod phyla and 0 articles from mollusca phyla. Somewhat unbalanced, IMHO. Can something be done in this regard? Thanks,
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2013	33	 Mollusca 	5	Yerpo	09:31, 13 August 2013 (UTC)	"Yes, I believe arthropods and insects outweigh the importance of molluscs. Both arthropods and insects are by far the largest taxa on their respective taxonomic rank, and, well, their importance can't be overstated. Groups such as spiders, mites and crustaceans would be completely unrepresented were it not for inclusion of their parent taxon, which would make no sense.
As luxury materials source and pathogens, the role of Molluscs is negligible (at most a few species each), so what remains is use as a food source and ""popularity"". Bluntly put, Bivalves are semi-important as food and Cephalopods are popular, but not nearly as important (or popular) as Insects by themselves, nor are they together as important as Arthropods or Insects. Instead, I could possibly support Mollusca replacing Chordata which is an undoubtedly important (in biological sense), but not very widely recognizable grouping. However, I'd like to hear another opinion first. —"

We should not decide upon our own taste. Schubert is much more popular: 13.458 entries at amazon.com (against 914 for Buxtehude), 731 000 results at GoogleBooks (against 57 300 for Buxtehude). The entry for Schubert in the Grove Dictionary, the most reliable music encyclopedia of the world, consists of ca. 64.500 words (including 261 positions of bibliography) while the entry for Buxtehude consists of ca. 12.000 words with 57 positions of bibliography. In no way we can say that musicologists or record labels or listeners are interested in Buxtehude more than in Schubert. And, to tell the truth, in general all of them are much more interested in XIX century's music than in the music of any previous period (though this priority is not so crucial nowadays as it was 100 years ago). So that it is quite reasonable that we have mostly composers of XIX century in the list.

Since Wikipedia does not restore any kind of historical fairness but rather reflects the objective situation, we should make choice between two classical composers based solely on their respective roles in professional literature. Without any doubt Schubert attracts much more attention of specialists and therefore replacing him with Buxtehude would be a deviation. --

The commons category direct to Apoidea but many articles are about the other ranks of ""bees"". Could this be clarified to what bee refer to as many might be ""wrong"". I am not sure but suspect that the same problem apply to about most animals and plants.

The term ""bee"" is indeed slightly complicated, because Anthophila, which are most commonly referred to as ""bees"", are a grouping with uncertain taxonomic position within the parent taxon. However, it is still a natural grouping, defined by structures for transporting pollen and the nectar/pollen diet, that deserves a place in this list because of its importance for pollination.
Apoidea includes wasps, for example (which are less important), while Apiformes is simply a synonym for Anthophila (that's why it's a redirect on :enwiki). The problem arises where the common name doesn't fully reflect the natural situation in scope (even Anthophila, which includes bumblebees that are excluded from the term ""bee"" in common use), but in this particular case, I believe it's not too far off. —"

In Swedish however I'd believe most people only refer to honeybees (Apis). When more precision is needed I think only scientific names are used. According to Catalogue of Life, Anthophila is a genus within Choreutidae! However Merriam Webster lists it as a synonym for Apoidea. 

My suggestion is to only rely on well known scientific names when including forms of life on this list and not the common English term for a kind of group of living things. Since we have to rely on a term easily translated to other languages if it is supposed to be on this list we should use something with a clear definition. Then it is either the scientific name or some other well defined feature commonly used in many languages. The same problem applies to Elephant where enwiki have different articles for the term Elephant (Elephantidae excluding mammoths) and Elephantidae (including mammoths). Other wikis might have just one of them and might consider it weird not to consider mammoths a kind of elephant since they are in the same family. -"

Which game would you remove to make space for this?  Since Wikipedia (in all its versions) is an on-line encyclopedia, topics related to computers and the internet are prominent in the minds of some editors, to an extent probably greater than their real importance in the broad sweep of history.  I'm not sure we can say now that video games are more important than, say, chess or soccer -- but let's revisit the topic in 100 years! :-)   I wouldn't say categorically that video games shouldn't be on this list, but I don't see what this article would displace."

If the readers of a particular wiki project can find articles on what they want to know about when they search for them it seems likely that they will spend more time using the wiki and hence being more inclined to help contribute to it. 
A basic suggestion for how the wants of readers could be ascertained is either to use google analytics/trends to find out what people in a particular language are searching for  when they include the terms wiki, wikipedia etc. Obviously using any data that is available about the actual search function within each wikipedia would be useful to. 
Anyway, it just seemed a little redundant to me to try and improve a wiki project by first improving articles that editors think are important if readers don't care about them."

However, the basic assumption is that the number of editors improving this page is large enough to give a meaningful approximation of what the readers might need, too. Additionally, the ""currently the most popular topics"" are something quite different than ""most important topics"". Do you really believe all Wikipedias should have an article about Kim Kardashian whom nobody will even remember in two years? I'm sure that she's being far more searched for right now than William Shakespeare (for example), but replacing him would make us laughing stock of pretty much everybody.
What you're suggesting would make sense for every Wikipedia separately - to help editors respond to trends, but not in a centralized way like this. So every local editor community would do this in their own project space. —"

Right now there are two articles on Hinduism, which is an important religion for sure, but Trimurti as a concept is still relatively peripheral and not so known (more useful/popular topics would in fact be Shiva or Vishnu, I think). Shinto is usually considered a world religion, but now it's missing. Also, there are already actually four major religions practised in India in the list: Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism and Jainisim, and Yoga as well. Of course Japan would then in a way have Shinto, Buddhism and Zen, but I think the list would still be more balanced. --

Jainism and Sikhism are also almost exclusively Indian practices, as is Trimurti as well. In any case Trimurti is not a good topic for this list, it's much too ""technical"" in the sense that it is rather a theological concept than something that is commonly used and easy to write about. According to one statistic (in Wikipedia) the largest religions in the world are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, various folk religions, Taoism and Confucianism, Shinto, Sikhism and Judaism. Jainism has much fewer followers and Zoroastrianism is a very small religion but they both have historical importance, so I do understand their inclusion, but Shinto is the only major singular religion currently missing from this list.

What sense does it make for a handful of people to issue a Fatwa to all the people working on different languages as if they simply have to reproduce the same set of articles? This is not the wiki-way and perhaps is better suited to Larry Sanger's Citizendium which uses a more top down approach which would enable those of us who see themselves as having expertise in such a generalist way to work without the constraint of taking into account those of us who want a more egalitarian approach. For myself, I feel it might be more useful if different language Wikipedias set their own targets, and perhaps a reasonably simple way could be used (perhaps with Wikidata) to link the different conceptions that would then emerge.

I certainly agree that the term should is not as strong as has to or even must, but even so it is stonger than suggest. However, I do not think that such fine points of English grammar should distract us from the main point, which is the bias in the list. I am not sure whether the issue can be sorted out using the one in, one out method, and certainly feel that the advent of Wikidata could help us find a way of co-ordinating between different languages wich does not involve producing Eurocentric lists like this.

As regards your view of the world being western-biased, even if this holds water, it only goes to highlight the ommission of Black musicians. I think you will find that such musicians as Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley are westen musicians.
I found MarsRover's point very interesting, and sympathise with anyone who stands back from such labour intensive work, particularly when there is some doubt about whether it will be well received. Of course we have Wikipedia article traffic statistics, and I hope no-one will get upset if I point out that for April 2013 Bob Marley came in at 387th (402,367 hits) whilst Ludwig van Beethoven was a little bit lower down the list at 810th (281,283 hits). As for Gustav Mahler I am sorry to report I could not find him in the list no matter how hard I looked.
right|thumb|House of Mirrors, a common feature at the funfair
Whilst I take on board the comment about wikipedia being a mirror, I feel that this page is perhaps somewhat more like the ""House of Mirrors"". I don't want to be a killjoy, and I know how much fun people can get from drawing up lists of their favourites under all sorts of categories. But I feel that it would be a good idea if this was done somewhere else. If there is to be List of articles every Wikipedia should have then I feel it requires a lot more thought. I also hope that when I point out a lack of research skills amongst engaged editors, this is not a matter of calling people incompetent, but rather indicating that the questions which arise from having a page like this may involve serious reflection concerning how can enhance the collective pool of skills, ideally simplified through the development of new tools, so that we can address the shortcomings of the list."

However, me being upset (if you insist on talking about me, although ""annoyed"" would be a better description) stems largely from the fact that you started criticizing our work, indirectly and without providing a clear alternative. Even if you didn't intend it, your hint dropping came across as smug, which continues with your last message. The present list was given a lot of thought - 10 years of it, to be precise.

There isn't a lot of commenters in this list so I am willing to accept any suggestions about articles or methodology.  But you haven't really offered any specific yet. Using popularity as a way to get importance will just mean this is the ""list of the most popular articles"". The original goal of this list was to promote articles that are obviously important but missing. Promoting already popular articles is a really unnecessary task. So, IMHO, if you were to tweak the methodology I would not go in that direction. I do believe it can be tweaked in other directions. Perhaps we have a rule, the topic must have had influence in more than one continent. Is Bob Marley important outside North America? Is Gustav Mahler important outside Europe?  --MarsRover 20:25, 10 April 2014 (UTC)

Well, I am also not the only person to be ""annoyed"" by the bias in this list, as anyone who looks through the archives can verify. I agree that popularity has its shortcomings. However, it does have the advantage in that we can consider it in a more objective way, whereas I am not sure how we can approach ""importance"" in a clearer way. It is hard for me to come up with solutions unless you can tell me what you mean by this category. Otherwise we are dealing with what a mentioned above, a ""systemic unknown"". In fact, I would suggest that it is a sounder approach to start off with an analysis of the problem, rather than a putative solution, because otherwise we are likely to get into the sort of futile discussion, we can be worse than annoying.
[[File:Continental models-Australia.gif|thumb|300px|Animated, color-coded map showing the various continents and regions. Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often subdivided into Europe and Europe (red shades), while North and South America are sometimes recognized as one American continent (green shades).]]
Thanks to MarsRover for the suggestion of using what we might call the ""continent approach"". Assuming we set aside antarctica, when we compare the continental populations, it is a bit disturbing to discover that Australia, population 29,127,000, would have the same weight as Asia, population 4,164,252,000, a ratio of 1:143. Or comparing two hit scenarios, Europe and Australia add up to 767,326,000 whereas Africa and Asia add up to 5,186,486,000 a ratio of 1:6.76. However, as it is two hit measures this has to be more or less squared, giving a figure of around 1:45. Bearing in mind the demographics of the countries involved, this way would also be liable to bias, even if it gives us a clearer idea of how that bias arises. Unless we simplify things by reducing it to ""important in Asia"" (as 60% of the world's population live there), I think we need another approach. I wonder if we can agree on a shared notion that importance is related to human beings. Would that be a useful next step?"
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2014	2	Musicians	12	Leutha	20:35, 11 April 2014 (UTC)	"I agree ""importance is related to human beings"" but not sure exactly what you mean. I wouldn't want to weight the article counts by population counts. Otherwise we'll just mainly have Chinese and Indian articles.
My suggestion, as a way to finally get rid of the constant complaint that the list is biased, would be that the topic must be important to more than one culture. (Instead of continents we could use a  world map of cultures). The means a Western person only important in the West would not be in the list. An Asian person only important in Asia is not in the list. This could dramatically change the list of people which seems to be the articles most complained about. But beware this might mean Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix are not getting in the list. But an argument could be made for someone like Youssou N'Dour if he is important enough in Europe. Also, in thinking this though it might caused Shakespeare and George Washington to be removed since not sure what other cultures view them as important. 
Also, another way to tackle the problem is to say within each category the articles must be evenly divided between cultures. So, we can still have extremely important topics for a specific region. So, within Musicians the 21 articles must cover the 6 cultural regions. (3 or 4 Western musicians, 3 or 4 Asian musician, etc). --MarsRover 19:19, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
I think that's quite an interesting idea. Bearing in mind that we are talking about suggestions for different languages we could go for away of linking languages to different cultures. Then each culture could have its own list of important pages, with a way of then generating a more global list on the basis of frequency of appearance in these different lists. This would mean that no-one would necessarily face the daunting task of wondering how popular Mahler is in Africa, unless they had elected to work on that culture. Secondly, for the list to work as a prompt, it could be made more meaningful, so that an African language such as Eʋegbe would have one list geared principally around African culture, and with a smaller global list emerging in addition. We should also bear in mind that the list is most useful to those languages with the least articles."

But to have one list of 1000 articles that evenly covers the six cultures. The complaints about the existing list are almost without fail about the 120 biography articles which make up list. The remain 880 articles would probably be in all six lists if you went that direction. (eg. Electricity is important to every culture). But six completely different lists is a valid idea. I just would have it be a parallel project and not a replacement for this list. Sort of like the List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded, you could have List of articles every Wikipedia should have/African, List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Western, etc. --MarsRover 07:04, 12 April 2014 (UTC)
That's a good point about the biography articles. I think perhaps that is where the contentious points arise. Presumably there is no reason to have 1000 articles except that it relates to the number of fingers most people have. Perhaps we could have List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Biographies which could them break down to the different cultures. Perhaps we could look at the state of play on some of the small wikis?"

Anything we link to these entries is relinked to a different entry. There is no notion in Ukrainian that is the exact equivalent of the English notion of Mind. Electromagnetism is a term that is used very rarely in Ukrainian. The meaning, though, is completely equivalent to the Classical electrodynamics. In the students curricula it is under the Electricity. --93.72.155.13 06:54, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

 English chapter does not have an entry on :en:Electromagnetic interaction. Is it a redirect to Electromagnetism. I feel the two are not the same, but my language is not English. I cannot control what wikidata does. They did not like the link to the Classical electrodynamics and made it Electromagnetic interaction. I worked on :uk:Електромагнітна взаємодія a little. Then, they relinked it to another entry in wikidata and now Electromagnetism is not linked to anything in ukrwiki at all. --194.44.219.225 12:34, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
 In the list, Electromagnetism is present as one of four fundamental interactions (together with Gravitation, Strong interaction, and Weak interaction). In Ukrainian and Russian, the corresponding terms (Електромагнетизм, Электромагнетизм) are related rather to the classical electrodynamics than to the electromagnetic interaction. So, the corresponding articles in the Ukrainian and Russian wikipedias should be Електромагнітна взаємодія and Электромагнитное взаимодействие (literally: electromagnetic interaction). I have linked the English article Electromagnetism in wikidata to Q849919 (Electromagnetic interaction), hope it is correct. --"

This is a general problem of the list. Article structures differ between wikis, so you won't always find a 1:1 match even if the topic is covered.

There are very few biographies in this group. We must remember that although in Europe religion is not so important nowadays, it has been always the most important thing in the history – and still is for the most of the world (America, Africa, South Asia). For example, we should certainly add John Paul II – considering especially the lack of contemporary people in this category. He is more important that formerly present here Mother Teresa. What do You think? Let's discuss that, because this is an evident defect of this list. Best greetings,

John Paul II doesn't seem to have such a lasting reputation and is already being shadowed by the current superstar pope in public perception (at least that's my personal impression). Therefore, I do not feel that he deserves a place here. The problem is that most religious figures' importance is limited to their particular religion, while for example the importance of inventors or scientists is more universal. And we are trying to build a list that's as universal as possible. —

John Paul the Great is also widely recognizable. Of course, now we have another pope, so JP2 is in some sense in his shadow, but JP2 was even bigger superstar. And the impact of this person is not restricted only to one religion. He was the main leader of the whole christianity and worldwide religion in general. He was engaged so much in the ecumenical and interreligious dialogue. He was also a political leader who has made the communism collapse. He is considered as well the greatest Pole ever, more than Chopin, Copernicus and Curie, who are listed here. Thus he has become a saint in few years' time, one of the fastest record ever. Any anyway, it is quite obvious to set here some popes, as the greatest religious figures of the world, and JP2 is the main candidate for that. Best regards,

PS: the distinction between ""never attending church"" and ""never having been there at all after baptism"" is superficial and irrelevant for the essence of my message - that religion is not so terribly important to quite a large proportion of people labelled as Catholics, contrary to your (unsupported, ergo POV) claims. Yes, religion is (still) important, that's why it's represented by all sorts of entries thoughout this list, from artists, thinkers and actual leaders to basic concepts and history. But it doesn't follow that one particular, non-universal religious denomination should be so overrepresented as you proposed. —"

If You feel insulted, that's a pity. We both agree that religion is important for many people. However, Catholicism is not only a denomination; Catholic means just universal. It wouldn't be overrepresented. Numbers do not mislead, if they are applied in the logical order. Catholics are the majority of Christians. And Christianity is the main religion of the world.

It's pretty clear that not all that it's important for some group fits in here. For all those important articles not listed here we can always create a project in a particular Wikipedia (or even a multilanguage project, why not?) in order to improve the topic, e.g. Wiki Religion (see for instance Wiki Medicine which became a User Group). I don't agree to include more articles on Catholicism here, because there are many fields of knowledge to cover in an encyclopedia, and we simply shouldn't choose just one to list as ""articles every Wikipedia should have"". We expect every Wikipedia to be neutral (it's a pillar of our project) and general (not a thematic encyclopedia, dedicated to music, to a TV show, to sport teams, to religion, etc.). The articles you suggested here are indeed important, that's why they fit in Wikipedia (if they weren't, they could be deleted anytime), but they are all related to a same topic, aren't them? And you suggested articles from other topics to be replaced by them, do you see the impact of this change? Should we really diminish other sections in order to have more catholic biographies in this list? I don't think so. But as you said, Peter is as important as Paul, so if you want to replace one by the other, i'm fine to discuss it."

Religion is the most important thing for more people than other fields of life which have nevertheless still more biographies in this list. Therefore, everything is in the right proportion. Notice also that in other categories most of items are from the Western Civilization, as it plays indeed the leading role in the world. And it is not Eurocentrism; it is only respect for facts.

And POV on top of that, because you never back up your statements with any reference, instead expecting us not to question your self-declared ""vast encyclopedical knowledge"" (which is arrogant, by the way).
You proposed to add 5 people who have no importance whatsoever outside Christianity (and, except Peter, are even not important to full one third of Christians or more). It's simply too narrow focus, however important you say Christianity is. Much more suitable for this list are entries like Leonardo da Vinci, who is universally regarded as one of the greatest artists in history, and has created mostly works with Catholic motifs, therefore he's also important to the largest, but non-universal religious denomination in question. As I said, there are lots of biographies and other articles like that scattered throughout this list, such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Hernán Cortés, St. Peter's Basilica, crusades, etc., etc. So it's definitely not true that Catholicism is underrepresented. —"

It's only one religion. It doesn't matter if this is the ultimate most important thing on the world (even if this was true), it's only one topic.

Cholera causes a form of gastroenteritis, so while a very important subject the term also includes similar diseases caused by other pathogens. Often the treatment is similar, and in lieu of having both we should choose gastroenteritis. 
Lungs are covered under respiratory system, and in such a limited list it is superfluous to include both. That said I'm willing to replace respiratory system with lungs.

With important entries like Ibn Battuta, Zheng He and the Gupta Empire, it is less anglo-centric and less euro-centric than most of these types of lists. Kudos to the creators for achieving that.  There are still some critical gaps though, and it will require some additional work to make the list truly global in nature. 
Under History, I suggest adding the following four topics:
 Mali Empire, the richest civilization during the 14th century, with extensive trade reaching three continents, and with a highly developed and sophisticated culture. In comparison, Medieval Europe was at the time a stagnant backwater. 
 Maya, one of the great early civilizations in the world, an independent inventor of writing and with sophisticated science and architecture.
 Inca, the great civilization of South America, with direct or indirect reach over almost a whole continent
 Sumer, the cradle of western civilization. While Sumer is part of Mesopotamia, which is on the list, it definitely deserves its own entry.

Of course, to add also means to subtract. I propose removing the Hundred Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, The crusades and the Treaty of Versailles. These are all important events in European history, but they are not the most important and defining trends of European history, which are represented by the existing entries of Medieval Europe, The Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation and World War 1. For example, the Hundred Years' War was a long lasting local skirmish between the French speaking lords of France and the French speaking lords of England, neither of which were of global importance at the time, and the Thirty Years' War was one of many violent periods in European history.  

To double check my own thoughts on this, I consulted Felipe Fernandez-Armestos book Millenium: The history of the last 1000 years, which attempts to take a truly global perspective on world history. The Maya, Inca and Mali Empire all have several pages devoted to them, while the Hundred Years' War is not mentioned at all, the Thirty Years' War is given a couple of paragraphs, and the Treaty of Versailles is briefly mentioned in the chapter on the First World War. The Crusades get almost the same amount of coverage as the Maya and the Inca, but considerable less that the Mali Empire. (Sumer is older than 1000 years so it falls outside the scope of the book).

In summary, in order to make the list more global and less euro-centric, my suggestions are to include: 
 The Mali Empire instead of the Hundred Years' War
 The Maya instead of the Thirty Years' War
 The Inca instead of the Treaty of Versailles, and 
 Sumer instead of The Crusades. 
Looking forward to hear what others think."

With only 45 entries, the history section is surprisingly short compared to some of the other sections. To make room for both the Maya Civilization and the Inca, I suggest that we instead remove Esperanto, a constructed European language with 2000 native speakers and a couple of million fluent speakers overall. While Esperanto has some interest as the most successful constructed language, there are hundreds of languages around the world that are more commonly spoken, including Quiché, a modern Maya language with 2.3 million native speakers.

I am sorry, this is not what I consider to be appropriate. Esperanto has a very special role in the world. It's not amazing that Esperanto is offered on a lot of language learning sites. A search of ""Esperanto"" via Google gets at least 100 million results. Just to count the number of speakers is not enough to understand the special role of this language. We should consider e. g. that China publishes daily news in Esperanto, along with only nine other languages. Esperanto has a world wide role and there are not a lot of languages that are learnt in so many countries.
 Martinogk argued that e. g. Hundred Years' War is also part of Medieval Europe. OK. But with the deletion of Esperanto the whole subject and the idea of an international language, much quicker to learn than other languages, is omitted.  --"

The fact that English is the most learned and used foreign language is nothing new in principle in human history - there were international languages like Latin or French before English. The unique thing with Esperanto is that one man put together the basis of Esperanto. Then people learned Esperanto and are still learning Esperanto and an international language community of a new kind was created and is expanding more and more. This community developed its own culture with books and songs etc., being a supranational community. This is something quite different from English. There is no real alternative between English and Esperanto (as many people seem to believe) - Esperanto has a very distinct approach, it's rather a complement. This special aspect of Esperanto was one main reason to include it in this wikipedia list. 
 The other relevant aspect certainly was the fact that Esperanto can be learned in about a fourth of the time needed for English and similar languages. This also is a unique aspect of the language Esperanto and one more reason why Esperanto should be included again. (And thanks that you agree about the method of deletion.) --"

Just reading the wikipedia article about Esperanto will help them to understand their errors. I do not speak about facts without sources, so RIGHTGREATWRONGS is not relevant here.

If I understand his very brief remarks correctly, he is convinced that this list should rather reference the fruit  (class: ), but seems not to bother to do anything about it, so let me play proxy here for his request:  asks to replace Lemon(-tree) (Q500) with Lemon(-fruit) (Q1093742). See also 

The same issue also applies to  (listed here as a taxon under foodstuffs/fruit as Soybean), but I couldn't find a separate article or wd-item for its fruit/bean.

Following his request, we would consequently replace the plants with the fruits (lemon for now) and end up with no english (or simple) articles for it. I find this problematic due to the nature of this list, but it is certainly possible. E.g. in german we can live with those holes as we include see-also-notes with them . But whoever wants to track adoption of this list automatically will have to deal with it (already).

 has far more sitelinks than  138 vs 25. 
 The taxon-item has sitelinks to simple and german talking about fruit and taxon, englisch says it's about the fruit, but actually also is about both. 
 The fruit-item has no sitelinks to english, no german, no chinese...

As a general rule, we could keep Wikidata-Items for taxons on this list as long as there are no separare Wikidata-Items for their fruits. Thus soybean would be replaced as well, once we find the fuit item.

My intend here is to seek clarification and as a German could also live without a sitelink to english, especially as lemon only appears there in the expanded list (level 4, 10.000 articles). --"

My edition was reverted when I changed  for  and I'm going to explain why I think it might be in that way. Firstly, let's take a look to this list. In Foodstuffs, part 7 is about fruits (), defined here in wikidata as a ""part of a flowering plant"" but I prefer the more complete definition in the english wikipedia: ""a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants"". Taking in account these definitions, it seems to be clear that the fruit is not the whole plant or tree. Now, let's take a look to the fruits mentioned in this part 7 and their definitions in the linked pages in wikidata:  ""fruit of the apple tree"",  ""fruit"",  ""the fruit, use Q191019 for the genus, use Q30046 for the species"",  ""species of plant"",  ""nothospecies of plant (for lemon use Q1093742)"" and  ""edible seed (with or without the rest of the fruit)"". We can see that 4 out of 6 linked pages in wikidata talk about fruit (it could be doubtful ""nut"", but an extended definition of fruit is ""any plant product useful to man, including grain, vegetables, etc"" or ""any edible part of a plant"", but never the whole plant). As a conclusion, in my opinion, there are two mistakes concerning to ""soybean"" (in this list, it might be only the grain of the plant) and ""lemon"" (clearly concerning to ). I think that  has far more sitelinks than  is not a strong reason to maintain  because a repeated mistake (in my modest opinion, of course) doesn't make it true. Most of the languages that sounds, more or less, familiar to me, make the difference between the fruit and the fruit tree: lemon and lemon tree (english), limón and limonero (spanish), citron and citronnier (french), zitrone and zitronenbaum (german), limao and limoeiro (portuguese), limón and limoeiro (galician), llimona and llimoner (catalan), limone and (albero di) limone (italian); but only two (french and galician) have a page for everyone. The other have only one page for the lemon tree or two pages, being one a redirection to the other. On the contrary, for example,  and  have their own page on everyone of the mentioned wikis. Why all of these wikis have different pages for ""grape"" and ""grape vine"" but not for ""lemon"" and ""lemon tree""? That seems not to be so coherent. Yours, --"

This looks like a mixup because it is not about the pyramids but about the surrounding cemeteries. Surely the whole Giza Pyramid complex is meant, of which the cemeteries (""necropolis"") are not the main interest.  So I propose to link to  Giza Pyramids (Q12508) ."

I think it will upset a lot of people who organized their wikipedia a bit differently but the German Wikipedia shows after you expand both articles.

I guess if people organized different then with a look at this list and the connected ranking. But i do not see any reason to keep articles about the bunch of graves around Giza among the 1000 most important topics every wikipedias should have. The argument is for the pyramids; and also the German article de:Nekropole von Gizeh which is now connected to this  entry has no place among the 1000 top, the de:Pyramiden von Gizeh however is, even though not connected here. So what can be done to correct this?"

There are a lot of articles that have even more challenging issues (e.g. Is ""blindness"" or ""sight impairment""? Is this ""nose"" or ""human nose""?

I agree, both about Giza and about the larger problem.  In Latin Wikipedia we spend a lot of time chasing our tails as the specific Wikidata items on lists like this one keep flopping around;  neither English, nor German, nor any other of the big WPs seems to have an ideal organization for everything!"

Rosa was a Polish revolutionary woman, fighting for the rights of the working class, and unfortunately she got brutally murdered and thrown in the river in Berlin by a German socialist militant dictator. While Trotsky was quite a murderous git himself, he used to be Stalin's henchman (much like Lenin) and led the ""Trotsky slaughterers"" - a squad effing opponents until Trotsky himself fell out of Soso's favour and had to flee. Leonid wasn't exactly as warm and endearing as the Hollywood Frida-Hayek movie portrays him as.

While there may be certain nuances of meaning between these two terms in certain languages, in many other languages they may not be substantial enough to merit separate articles.

Cities
The list of cities is truly global in perspective, which is very nice and impressive to see. I would suggest a few minor tweaks though:
Replace Bogota with Colombia
Replace Nairobi with Kenya
While both Bogota and Nairobi are natural members of a list of the most important cities in the world, I think it is more important to include their respective countries, which are among the largest and most important on their continents.

The only truly global city that is missing from the list is Canton/Guangzhou, which is not only one of the biggest cities of the world with over 20 million people in its metropolitan area, but also the cultural and historical center of southern China, with several hundred million people. To make room for Canton, I would remove Vatican City. Both Rome and the Catholic Church are on the list, which is good, and I do not think we need the Vatican City as well.

As a very minor item, one could also consider moving the city-state of Singapore from the list of countries to the list of cities. While the city and the country are the same, as a city Singapore is of truly global importance, but as a country it is rather small and less important than for example neighboring Malaysia. 

Countries
To make the list of countries more global in nature, I would add
The Phillippines, with over 100 million people it is the largest country not currently on the list
Colombia, with 49 million people, one of the major countries in South America
Kenya, with 47 million people, one of the major countries in Africa
Syria, with 18 million people, and historically a very important country.
Morocco, with 34 million people, a culturally and historically important country in both Africa and in the Arab world
Yemen, with 27 million people, also historically very important
Guatemala, with 16 million people, which is both historically and currently the most important country in Central America.
What seven items do we then remove? In addition to (i) Bogota and (ii) Nairobi, mentioned above, I suggest removing (iii) Austria with 9 million, (iv) Switzerland with 8 million and (v) New Zealand with 5 million people. Regarding Austria, I rather keep Vienna on the list, for its historical and cultural importance. With two more to go, it is hard to find other candidate countries to remove. Instead, I suggest removing (vi) the North Sea. There are other Seas that are equally or more important, such as the East China Sea,  the South China Sea, the :en:Sea of Japan, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Mexico, but I find it more desirable to include more countries than more seas. It is also questionable if we need to have (vii) Ocean on the list since we already have Sea. It is linguistically a little tricky though, as these have slightly different meaning in English (Sea can mean either part of an ocean or the collection of all oceans), while most languages have a word that are commonly used for all three concepts, such as mar in Spanish, hav in Norweigian, and Meer in German, even though some also use an ocean equivalent word as a less used specialty term.

Islands
While the list includes the longest rivers, the tallest mountain, the biggest lakes, all the oceans and the most extensive dessert, the biggest island is missing. I suggest adding Greenland, while removing the Arctic ocean. 

Looking forward to learn what others think."

 In the list of countries, Myanmar, Malaysia and Peru should also be included. Peru is more important than Guatemala, both in size and history. As a Central American country, Cuba is included, which is smaller than Guatemala although I do not know if it is of more interest. As there is limited space to include countries, I would choose one or the other.
 In cities I would remove Washington DC. The only relevant reason to include that city is that it is the capital of United States, but is it enough? If being the capital of an important country is enough to be included in the list, then Brasília should also be included, which is larger. Honestly, I do not think that reason is enough, and neither by size nor importance do I see reasons to maintain it.
 I see no reason to change Singapore from ""countries"" to ""cities"" only because as a country it is small. In general it is considered a country (even if it is a city-state), which also has a special relevance in Asia. I would keep it as such.
 I see no reason to include Greenland. Although we include it as an island, the Wikipedias will treat it as a country.
 I see no reason to eliminate Ocean. Although sea and ocean may be similar, I believe that all languages ​​have a different term for both concepts, so in all languages ​​there is therefore a difference in the concept. If there was a language in which it was not, we could study the case, but otherwise I see no reason to eliminate any.
Therefore, of the 7 countries that you propose, I would remove Guatemala and I would include the 3 that I have indicated, with which we would have 9 countries to add.
In addition to the indicated cities and countries for remove, I would also remove Washington DC, so we have 6 spaces. In seas I would add article Seven Seas (very poor article in English for a very important historical denomination) and remove the seas from that list (Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Mediterranean Sea) and also the North Sea. In this way we have 3 more spaces, with a total of 9 spaces for the indicated countries. The doubt could be with the Mediterranean Sea, which is an important sea, but I think it would be covered by the article of Seven Seas. --"

Comments about the different proposals :
  Replace Bogota with Colombia : I think it's a good idea. Even if Bogoto is a major city, Colombia is one of the most important regional in South America and, to me, the country is more important than its capital.
  Replace Nairobi with Kenya : for the same reasons (Kenya is one of the regional power in East Africa).

  Remove Austria but {{support} Remove Viena : AMHO, Austria is the heir Austria-Hungary which was a major power in Europe during centuries and an important cultural center. AMHO, keeping Austria will allow to remove Viena (which is the center of Austrian culture) and to justify easily the absence of Austria-Hungary.
  Remove Swiss : Swiss is of course not a very populated area but the country has an important politic and economic influence.
  Remove Vatican City : AMHO, the proposal is right : Vatican is included in Catholic Church.
  Remove New Zealand : AMHO, the country is not a regional power in Oceania (it's Australia) and its cultural and economic influence is limited.
  Include Song Dynasty which is missing despite its importance in Chinese History.
  Include Yemen and Syria as there are historical region.

  Remove Black Sea, Caspian Sea and North Sea : there are important geopolitical and economic theatres but we can consider others elements (as major countries) are more important.
  Then include Phillippines (a demographic and regional power), Morocco (a regional power with an important cultural and historical influences) and Peru (major cultural importance in South America).

  Remove Arctic Ocean as it is one of the major ocean and an important region (future crude oil production area ? geopolitical issue between USA and Russia...). To me, Greeland seems to be included in Arctic Ocean (at least in the current list).
  Remove Mediterranean Sea (as explained).

  Include Seven Seas in the list : the concept was important during Middle Ages but, AMHO, it is just now an historical curiosity. Its presence in the list is then not expected.

This empire was dissolved in several states, Austria being one of them, but not the heir. That it is preferred to keep Austria instead of Vienna is something else (which I do not share), but not because he was the heir Austria-Hungary, since it is not. --

The family they belong to (Elephantidae) also includes mammoths, but there is no scientific group for elephants alone. I don't doubt the importance of the elephants, but the selected items shouldn't impose a structure in the languages on the articles to be included.

I agree in part with your opinion, but I'm not proposing to change ""Elephant"" to ""Elephantidae"".

However, for most languages, Americas is a single continent, and the North/South division is political, and not geographical. In fact, the normal thing in almost all languages ​​is to use North/Central/South America as a political division of a single continent, not including Central America as part of North America. It is enough to see the articles linked in Wikidata to North America to realize that there is no uniform criterion and in most cases they don't refer to the subcontinent. Some only include United States and Canada; others add to Mexico, and only a few add Central America. International organizations such as UN, IOC, etc., also recognize Americas as a single continent, this being the most globally accepted meaning. I don't find a reason to maintain the sense of the english language that is a minority and that in most languages ​​is a political concept and not a geographical. I propose to eliminate items from North and South America as continents and to include only Americas as a single continent, since this is the most universally accepted meaning.

In the free space, I realize that there is not an element as important as Water, essential for life. I propose to include it also with bold.

When reading this list, ""anime"" stuck out to me as an entrant. We already have ""animation"". There should be sufficient information on anime within the animation article, right? It seems just a little too specific for this list. Checking the archives shows a bit more talk about anime's worthiness, too. I suggest replacing it with ""video game""(Q7889), a topic that by contrast seems too broad for its containing article, ""game"". There's incredible variation within video games, and, unlike most other kinds of game, the video game is often considered an emerging art medium.

I've been working since mid-2017 on African language WPs (zu, xh, ig, rw) with few active contributors and no admins to consult. They tend to include geography and biography pages, minimally categorized, and weak in the sciences. They're starting to recruit and train new editors (including academics), but what I'm seeking for their benefit is a framework to guide content development. Of course I'd rather not reinvent the wheel! Yoruba WP (which is relatively active), for example, has done well with the WP:Vital 100 but those topics are still quite rudimentary - while YO WP's five-figure page count is bloated with bio pages and stubs of European and Asian intellectuals and politicians, and content on their own people (particularly in the arts and letters) is sorely lacking.

I want to start by saying I do not believe this is intentional. However, I think it is an oversight that needs correcting. This list serves an important purpose, particularly in smaller versions of Wikipedia. What this list currently does, however, is overwhelmingly promote a male-dominated view of history, of literature, of music, of politics, and even of film and television. Given that the articles on this list are used as a basis, the omission of women (who make up less than 5 per cent of people on the list) clearly gives a skewed version of history.

I would like to hear both whether people think this is a problem at all, and if so, what ought to be done to remedy it. I would favour a quota system of sorts, ensuring that no more than 60 per cent of people in any given category (and 60 per cent of bolded biographies) are not of any one gender. There are enough notable women in history, but this list, by and large, ignores them, to the detriment of readers. --"

 Again, I stress that this is merely illustrative, as I know little to nothing about non-Abrahamic faith, nor of any notable women involved in the development of those faiths that perhaps could be included. If we wanted a gender-balanced list for this, perhaps Mary Baker Eddy could be considered. However, while she is included on the expanded list, my feeling is that she's a bit of a 'lightweight' compared to the rest. --"

The difference is if we're recommending (or forcing) different wikipedias to create articles based off this list - we should make sure we include articles from every main area (African culture, Asian culture, European culture) The English list people skate by on a technicality - for example Wagner being seen as more important to cover on a English encyclopedia rather than Saladin due to being more important to ""western civilization"". (despite the crusades being inevitably more important than opera). Here we don't focus (we do but should not) on western civilization, we should try and cover every civilization. Or in simpler terms noone on the English list will swap Bach, Mozart, Beethoven or Wagner for Piaf, Fela Kuti, Teresa Teng or Umm Kulthum - but when we list Dvořák and Dietrich we have room to swap them on this one, do you see how it's obvious a Malay or Yoruba wiki should cover African music, Asian music, European music and Women in music, all kinds of music - not just two?

Here's how you build a more representative ""world"" culture on a world list;
Bold Chaplin/The Beatles - film and popular music should have a bold as they are big worldwide

Swap HC Anderson for Chinua Achebe (Brothers Grimm are more important to fairy tales)
Swap Chekov for Murasaki Shikibu
Swap Ovid for Sappho
Swap Marlene Dietrich for Jane Austen (Marilyn/Sarah Bernhardt are enough)
Swap Dvořák for Bob Marley
Swap Tchaikovsky for Ravi Shankar
Swap Mahler for Umm Kulthum
Swap Rubens for Wang Xizhi (Greatest calligrapher - of which Calligraphy is a major art in Eastern culture)
Swap Spielberg (still alive) for Anna Pavlova

That would inherently make this list a world list, covering most forms of culture big outside of the west, with more of a balance towards women aswell. As it stands this list is kinda perpetuating bias by having European men centered in the biographies section on a world list. For example - by this list we would create a article on Rubens in Malay - but it would be better to cover Wang Xizhi, considering massive Chinese influence in Malay culture (and this goes for many other countries with Chinese culture - thus since Chinese culture is so widespread - it should be essential to cover a Chinese artist - meanwhile we cover European art with many other artists). This ofcourse would never pass but this is how this list is made better, not by removing our only women - in which we are already under-covered and thus already have perpetuated a bias to the world's coverage of art, encouraging European art over any others and men over women."

He was recently swapped with Presley on vital articles. I think this would be a good swap for this list.

I think The Beatles are the best rock representatives from 60’s-70’s time period, and Elvis Presley doesn't add anything additional, since he was not a great songwriter, not a great creator (which is, after all, a key characteristic of artists). There are others music artists (like Freddie Mercury or Chuck Berry) better suited to be considered creators and Rock music icons. In addition, Michael Jackson has a greater influence than Elvis on other artists and the music panorama. --

That speaks volumes. Jackson reach was far more reaching than that of Elvis who mostly appealed to English speaking countries. Jackson is known around the globe and has a massive following from North and South America, to Asia, Europe, many African countries and villages, to even Russia. What separates the two is this global reach. I’ve met over a dozen people who, like me, has learned to speak English because of Michael Jackson’s music. No one has ever said that about Elvis.

 I hope we can all recognize that what happens on a list with 126 people is different on a list with 200. This list can have both (swapped with a weak composer like Dvorak). This would not be a good swap. On a (global) list with 21 musicians, we shouldn't have 17 western classical and just 4 pop musicians (the Beatles, Elvis, Kulthum and Louis Armstrong). We should fix bias, not reinforce it. There was no need for Piafs removal here too. We could've had two women listed, which obviously would've been better - but now that opportunity is gone. Bob Marley, Michael Jackson, Fela Kuti, Teresa Teng and Ravi Shankar are all good nominations for A GLOBAL project since they represent music from around the globe. If you just blindly put up these noms in a hurry, please be strategic atleast to actually cover the globe on a global list."
