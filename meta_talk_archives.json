Roosevelt is one of the most important president in the history of US. Shaka is an important king in Africa but it is not more important than others African kings of the period (Usman dan Fodio, Omar Saidou Tall...). Regarding Ayn Rand, she's an infuential essayist in the US but her theory (laissez-faire, importance of individual rights...) was better described by others philosophers or economists. And Sartre developped original theories (existentialism...) was a key figure of the philosophy of the 20th century. Best regards, --[[User:Nicolas Eynaud|Nicolas Eynaud]] ([[User talk:Nicolas Eynaud|talk]]) 08:07, 6 February 2020 (UTC)\n:: About bolding/unbolding changes, I think some propositions are very strange. For exemple, Guereva is an important figure but it's hard to considere him more important than Lenin. And it's the same with Money/Currency, Toy/Chess, Hinduism/Spanish, Christopher Columbus/Akira Kurosawa... Best regards, --[[User:Nicolas Eynaud|Nicolas Eynaud]] ([[User talk:Nicolas Eynaud|talk]]) 08:13, 6 February 2020 (UTC)\n\n:I oppose the unargumented additions and removals. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 10:12, 6 February 2020 (UTC)\n::Disagree on most of the bolds/unbolds. Strongly disagree on the removal of Roosevelt/Sartre. Shaka would be a good add, and despite the suggestion that Fodio and Tall are equal in prominence (they're not, he's clearly the most prominent pre-modern age African leader, with only Musa I of Mali coming close). Either way we should have atleast one of the pre-modern age African leaders listed, he is arguably more important than Guevara who doesn't stack up to Fidel Castro and i'd even list Toussaint Louverture over both Guevera or Castro as his impact had more of a revolutionary impact on the world than small island Cuba. Guevara and Castro have to compete with Ho Chi Minh too in 20th century revolutionary prominence, so Guevara would be the weakest entry point for a pre-modern age African figure like Shaka. But we don't list African cultural figures like Fela Kuti or Chinua Achebe, and we don't cover ANY ancient pharaoh like Ramesses II, which would be a better add than Shaka anyway, but both would fit. (yes i know, Naguib Mahfouz is listed but considering we list Abu Nuwas, i'd prefer a swap of Mahfouz with Achebe). \n\n::Now Ayn Rand would only be vital as a writer, her philosophical achievements would be below many other social scientists. But we don't have ANY women writers, which is a BIG miss, Sappho, Murasaki Shikibu, Jane Austen, Mary Wollstonecraft, Agatha Christie, Virginia Woolf, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, Emily Dickinson, George Eliot or Mary Shelley would all come before Rand and atleast one should be listed.\n\n::Here are my other suggestions that could be good additions in my opinion, to add to the spirit of this thread\n\n::1. Marlene Dietrich could be swapped for Anna Pavlova, since we already list two other actresses and Pavlova covers a more underrepresented field (dance) and Ballet has a longer European art history than German film (two American actresses would be too much, so i assume she's listed for her German work). Maria Callas would be the other choice for a older European artform like artistic singing/opera to be covered among popular singers, while increasing women.  Or even adding Coco Chanel, for another undercovered area.  \n::2. Wright brothers, Cai Lun, Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce, Alexander Graham Bell, Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re, Alessandro Volta all could have a place and also Hippocrates or Andreas Vesalius, since medicine is a vital field and we could do with another other than Pasteur. Fibonacci, Ptolemy and Francis Bacon would be good too.\n::3. Japan's a vital enough country to list a political leader like Hirohito (especially if we have De Gaulle) , Emperor Meiji or Oda Nobunaga\n::4. William the Conqueror should be listed\n::5. Henrik Ibsen/Brothers Grimm could be another add - Ibsen is more important than Hans Christian Andersen\n::6. one of the Beatles/Louis Armstrong/Elvis/\u00c9dith Piaf should be bold instead of Stravinsky, so atleast one non classical composer is bolded. One person from directors/screenwriters/actors should be bolded too, probably Chaplin or Kurosawa or Hitchcock. \n::7. Bruce Lee and Pel\u00e9 represent culture figures that are non European/American and would be a good counter. Someone like Bruce Lee holds as much weight in Asia itself as Marilyn Monroe does America. Pele is alive and i get that we probably shouldn't list alive people, but he'd be our one South American culture figure and arguably soccer has just as much of a impact around the world as major form of arts like  American film, of which we list 7 representatives. \n::8. Peter Paul Rubens should be swapped for Claude Monet, who had much more of a impact on modern art than Rubens, if we had to list a Flemish artist i'd prefer Jan van Eyck over Rubens for time period diversity. \n::9. I don't see why we should have Al-Ghazali over Ali and i don't see why we need too Buddhists and i would remove Nagarjuna for Maimonides. \n::10. Amelia Earhart could be a good add to add women to explorers and to cover aviators. Florence Nightingale would be a another good add. Emmeline Pankhurst wouldn't be out of place with MLK listed.\n\n::Anyway just thought i'd offer my thoughts as a outside observer, i disagree with most of these proposed edits and offered up some of my own people who could be decent picks on the list, thanks. [[User:GuzzyG|GuzzyG]] ([[User talk:GuzzyG|talk]]) 19:28, 9 February 2020 (UTC)\n\n:::The number of biographies (204) is too high. In my opinion for example Matisse, Rubens, Vel\u00e1zquez, Warhol, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Cartier, Dietrich, Spielberg, Berners-Lee, Joule, Chomsky, Che and Hegel can be removed. I can support adding Ramses, Sappho, Murasaki Shikibu (Genji is currently listed), Jane Austen, Hippocrates, Louis Pasteur or Claude Monet. I don't think that the list needs any dancer, opera singer or aviator. --[[User:Thi|Thi]] ([[User talk:Thi|talk]]) 14:46, 10 February 2020 (UTC)\n:::: {{Ping|Thi}} I would support al these remivals which yku suggested. But as for additions, for now I can support just Pastoue as number of biograpbies should be much lower. 12:16, 10 February 2021 (UTC)\n*'''Reasoning behind removing Roosevelt.''' {{re|Nicolas Eynaud|GuzzyG}} Of the 39 political leaders, ''4'' are United States Presidents and ''5'' are WW2-era World Leaders. FDR sits at the intersection of ''both groups'', and I'm sorry but the point of this list is not to find the most impactful leaders but to provide a variety of coverage. Replacing him with Shaka only makes logical sense as he is one of the most famous ''African'' leaders in history (Nelson Mandela is pretty lonely).<br /><s>'''Removal of Jean-Paul Sartre.''' To be honest, I don't care how it happens, but have way to many French philosophers on that list, and somehow do not have a '''single woman.''' If I suggested we axe Voltaire, people would've rioted. If I suggested we axe Descartes, the people would have rioted. If I suggested Rousseau or Beauvoir... same thing. The French don't have a monopoly on philosophy, and I picked the most well known woman philosopher I could think of.</s><br />'''Boldings.''' Besides maybe Guevara, no one has articulated any actual reasoning behind disagreeing with my proposed boldings. I clearly state at the beginning that the list should reflect a ''diversity of content'' which ''adequately reflects the archetypes of each list'' not what is or is not the most \"important\" of the list. That's why I would prefer we have Che Guevara over Fidel Castro; we already have too many dictators on the list and not enough revolutionaries. <br />I hope what I am saying makes more sense in context. &#8211;<span style=\"font-family:CG Times\">[[User:MJL|<span style=\"color:black\">MJL</span>]]&thinsp;[[User talk:MJL|\u2010'''Talk'''\u2010]]<sup>[[Special:CentralAuth/MJL|\u2616]]</sup></span> 00:04, 11 February 2020 (UTC)\n\n::No offense, {{u|MJL}}, but your reasoning on replacing Sartre makes no sense at all.

On enwiki's vital articles list, they have a formal procedure. For example, how do we know if we have consensus to add or remove something? Should we have a consensus on what to bold and what not to bold? Some things to think out. There could be a slower response to this one since this isn't as actively watched as enwiki's vital articles. [[User:Interstellarity|Interstellarity]] ([[User talk:Interstellarity|talk]]) 17:15, 8 February 2021 (UTC)\n\n: {{ping|Interstellarity}} Your open discussion at [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have#Creating a better list]] is probably the most helpful and best way to improve this list. However, to we have consensus from \"vrious diffrent users\" for \"ballanced list with global perspective\" I think we could introduce rule that one user can give just \"five proposals for removal per week\" and \"five proposals for addition per week\" (votings, could be doing ad infinitum) . Most active Wikipedians in that project should be welcomable for users who do not visit that page so often. This project certainly should not be dominated by handful of regulars user. This is for sure better to analyse twenty swap proposals from twenty various users than twenty from one person which can be combative (for example twenty swap proposals in biography, menwhile someone disagree the current quota is good), not? [[User:Dawid2009|Dawid2009]] ([[User talk:Dawid2009|talk]]) 10:09, 23 April 2021 (UTC)\n \t\n: As for that procedure on Enhlish Wikipedia (I am active Wikipedian on Eglish Wikipedia too). This is formal voting proces which have been work well. Honestly I like that process but on the other hand later or ealier in practice there are four disdvantages 1 this procedure in practice does not work when list is very not stable and have many mistakes which could be improved by WP:Bold (for example list of 50 000 articles on ENwiki, list of 10 000 articles on metwiki and even list of 1000 articles on metawiki as well IMHO). Firstly we should '''wait''' when metalist will be bit more stable. 2When there are very few participants in the project, there are no objections how long discussion should be openen before making closure, 30 days is usually too short time in practice to gain estailished consensus 3 On English Wikipedia this procedure does not go on pair with key Wikipedia's rule  [[en:Wikipedia:Involved|WP:involved]], most discussions are closed by nominators/supporters even though in every other place on Wikipedia this is doing by uninvolved person. 4 Disadvantage of the point 2 and disadvantage of the point 3 sometimes cause that there are beurocracy games there. Bot can archive ongoing discussion which was not closed by any user ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=909718416]). Or WP:Involved user can close the discussion during the same time when make last decidive vote in the proposal (like here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Vital_articles&diff=1019086054&oldid=1019078637], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=896185035], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Vital_articles/Archive_15#New_rule_to_wait_a_week_after_a_vote_has_received_enough_to_pass]), not giving time for opposers to keep oppose vote. This is my opinion about process on ENwiki. Like I said it work very well but probably the biggest disadvantage of that procedure is ignoring [[en:WP\"Involved|WP:involved rule]] because of when the rule WP:Involved is ignored, most active users have more influence for discussion than users who do not have so many time to check discussion regularry and do not bother to close the discussion. [[User:Dawid2009|Dawid2009]] ([[User talk:Dawid2009|talk]]) 10:09, 23 April 2021 (UTC)\n \n:: You make very good points about a lot of good things. The enwiki's vital article list is more structured when it comes to deciding if an article should be added or removed. This place doesn't have specific rules regarding when an article should be added or removed. I think it is worth discussing how to best approach this and how do we know when we have a consensus.

H C Andersen is by far more vital than Grimm Brothers as he is the most translated author from 19th century (yes, he is THE one), the most popular European writer in China (yes, probably more than Shakespeare.

Later or earlier personally I would remove all those biographies but I did not put vote at Tschaikovsky as there are also still other biographies which I would remove before Tschaikovsky but it jst me.

Although some of the changes are uncontroversial (for example, removing Vatican City and Singapore), I am not sure more biographies is what these lists need. Keeping it around 200 is fine, if all of these countries are removed, they should be replaced with other countries, I would suggest ones missing by population.

Could you elaborate on why swapping Marxism with Genocide would not be a good idea? Are you against both the removal and the addition or one of them?

As for Genocide/Marxism swap, I just think it\u2019s another controversially worded swap, I support having Genocide article in the list.\n \n::: As for why Marxism and Communism do not cover each other, it\u2019s because Marxism is (maybe wrongly) put in ideologies when it\u2019s more of an economic theory.

If so, it could reasonably have equal numbers of entries for each of the ten main classes\n::::000 \u2013 Computer science, information, and general works \n::::100 \u2013 Philosophy and psychology \n::::200 \u2013 Religion \n::::300 \u2013 Social sciences \n::::400 \u2013 Languages \n::::500 \u2013 Science and Mathematics \n::::600 \u2013 Technology and applied science \n::::700 \u2013 Arts and recreation \n::::800 \u2013 Literature \n::::900 \u2013 History and geography and biography [as a topic]\n:Following this plan, it would list biographies under the primary topic for which the biographee is known; for example, A. M. Turing's biography would go in class 510, \"Mathematics,\" and Nelson Mandela's would go in class 324, \"The political process,\" a subset of \"Political science\" (itself a subset of \"Social sciences\").

That makes sense to me, but it leaves UDC with only 9 top categories, which would give us about 111 articles per category.

[[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 00:44, 1 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Flemming ==\n\nI believe, as many others, that [[:en:antibiotics|antibiotics]] was the most important invention in the XX century medicine. It saved, by conservative estimations, about 2 billions of people, and significantly changed the life of mankind.  Many social changes are derivatives of invention of antibiotics.  Therefore, Alexander Fleming should be included into the list. I propose to exclude Chomsky. Yes, he invented Chomsly normal form and Chomsky hierarchy, but these are far less important than invention of antibiotics. His other linguistic ideas proved wrong or, at least, doubtful.  There is nothing original in criticism of American politics; lots of people critisized it.\n\nAlternatively, Chomsky could be replaced by Gregor Mendel. {{unsigned|Blednotik|05:35, 28 February 2009}}\n\n:In general, we prefer concepts over people here. So antibiotics should be included, not Fleming (who, according to historians, wasn't even the first to describe the effect). It would be a good idea to include [[:en:Antibiotic]] instead of [[:en:Noam Chomsky]], tho. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 07:41, 28 February 2009 (UTC)\n::Or antibiotics in place of penicillin -- the general as opposed to one case.

[[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 00:30, 1 March 2009 (UTC)\n::For mathematics, I would remove '''Square''', and add '''Ordinal''' and '''Cardinal''', which are quite more important: they generalize the notion of number to infinite, so in fact they have relation with some really fundamental concepts in mathematics. If it is a problem that there are two concepts, instead Square could be replaced by [[:en:Transfinite number]], though a general article is not that useful. --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 14:24, 3 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Problematic translations, or: Bad luck, if your language is too rich of words ==\n\n<small>Moved here from [[Talk:List of Wikipedias by sample of articles#Problematic translations, or: Bad luck, if your language is too rich of words]]</small>\n\n=== Behavior ===\n\nI accidentally found the article on [[:wikipedia:behavior]]. I sincerly do not find a translation to any of the [[:ksh:|Ripuarian languages]]. Once every few months, I try to pick a missing topic and write a Ripuarian stub or better for it. For \"behaviour\" I believe, it would have to be a disambiguation, but of a non-word.\n\nWe have a bunch of possible translations for behaviour. The English version of the article says: \"Behavior &hellip; ''refers to the [[:wikipedia:action (philosophy)|action]]s or [[:wikipedia:reaction|reaction]]s of an [[:wikipedia:object (philosophy)|object]] or [[:wikipedia:organism|organism]], usually in [[:wikipedia:Relational theory|relation]] to the environment. Behavior can be [[:wikipedia:conscious|conscious]] or [[:wikipedia:Unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[:wikipedia:overt|overt]] or [[:wikipedia:covert|covert]], and [[:wikipedia:voluntary|voluntary]] or involuntary.''\"\nWell said. This is a wide field, and some of our specific translations (briefly) are:\n* {{lang|ksk|Benimm}} - Social behavior, or conduct, of humans (and sometimes domestizided animal and pets)\n* {{lang|ksk|Ben\u00e4mme}} - similar, but seen from a different viewpoint, also well-behavedness\n* {{lang|ksk|Donn}} - willfull action\n* {{lang|ksk|Refl\u00e4x}} - unconscious involuntary reaction\n* {{lang|ksk|R\u00e4song}} - obedient behaviour (also including drill, and (possibly unwillfull) subordinaton)\n* {{lang|ksk|H\u00fcre}} - listening, including obedience, and reactive or responsive behaviour\n* {{lang|ksk|Jehorsche}} - another set of flavours of obedience\n* {{lang|ksk|Kujonneer}} - willfull treatment or mistreatment of subordinates or dependants, pestering, etc.\n* {{lang|ksk|Ajeere}} - to act, both consciously and unconsciously, visibly, in a noted way.\n* {{lang|ksk|Hanteere}} - to manually do something, to handle, etc. (There are dozens of excessively more specific words describing human (but not necessarily ''only'' human) handling, and similar activities. They all comprise some sort of behaviour)\nI'll stop here. The list is by far not complete. We lack a concept, and a word for it, summarizing all these interesting aspects into a topic such as \"behavior\". If we talk on \"behavior\" as in \"[[:wikipedia:behaviorism|behaviorism]]\", we use loanwords. Those are, of course, much more specific than their originals.\n\nOne of the downside of the possible translatons is that they are not very systematic. Mostly, we cannot take one ot the qualifiers of the English description and then have, say, two translations. \"Behaviour of an organism\" and \"behaviour of an object\", do not translate either. So, we cannot easily make a list, and say: ''the sum of all this is behavior, anything else is not.'' It would be too fuzzy.\n\nThere are lots of afterthoughts. The [[:wikipedia:Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]] comes to mind, and more philosophical questions like whether or not a concept, such as behavior, is useful and valid, even if a language has no word for it; and can people who lack the word indeed not use the associated concept in their thoughts, as [[:wikipedia:Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] suggests?\n\nLikely, there are more samples of words missing for translations to various languages. I just wanted to exemplify one a little bit, giving some background data. --[[User:Purodha|Purodha Blissenbach]] 11:23, 2 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n:I agree that [[:en:Behavior]] is a problematic entry. But I think this should be discussed at [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have]]. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 12:00, 2 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n::Thus copied. --[[User:Purodha|Purodha Blissenbach]] 23:12, 2 March 2009 (UTC)\n:As it's in a section about social behavior and human activity, I think {{lang|ksk|Benimm}} is the best match for the idea that wanted to be included in the list, despite the fact that the English term \"behavior\" is also applied to inanimate objects.  [[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 21:55, 3 March 2009 (UTC)\n\nA similar thing has happened with tax. There are much more concepts than the english 'tax', which is one article of this list.

For example, for two of the most important cultural worlds, the Chinese (China, Japan, Corea) and the Muslim (Arab and Persian cultures)  the most important art is not painting or even music, (arguably) it's calligraphy. There is not a single calligrapher in the list. It is just an example, but I think it is a good an example of what I mean.\n:::''To Meldor'': you are right, we should not equal 'population=importance', but what I have shown are very extreme differences.

A Korean emperor decided to switch from Chinese characters to an alphabet c. 1400.  He created a commission to do this, and the result promoted literacy in pre-modern Korea.  It also helped Koreans pioneer the printing press.  However, Tamil is also remarkable.  I know less about it, but the Tamil language itself is the oldest continuous written language in the world, since c. 200 AD.  All other written languages have changed in some way (i.e., Classical Chinese, wenyan, to vernacular Chinese, baihua).  Needless to say, native Tamil speakers need extensive education to learn how to read or even understand the news. I don't know anything about the Tamil alphabet or how it developed. I'll put it this way: as a language, Tamil is of great interest, whereas Hangul is of interest as an alphabet.  [[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 20:42, 2 April 2009 (UTC)\n:I'd agree not with including Hangul, but with [[:en:Sejong the Great|Sejong the Great]], the creator of Hangul.  As the creator of Hangul, he was one of the first modern linguists, describing the phonology and grammar of his language and writing a dictionary in an age where all the learned classes learned Chinese.  More than that, he is credited with a good number of inventions, feverently supported technology and literacy, was an author of several classic works, and was a notable military leader in his own right.  I'm not quite sure if Hangul is in the top 1000 most important articles (though it definately belongs in the top 10'000), but I think Sejong the Great may deserve a place.

I've also had a serious interest (linguistic and otherwise) in numerous other cultures.\n\nThis article is 80-90% western European/American, even though these populations are less than 10% of the world population and were probably less than that throughout most of world history.  It's also important to remember that this list is a model for wikipedias in other (minor) languages, most of which will also be non-western languages (e.g., the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia).  For example, African language wikipedias should certainly have some major Islamic figures.\n\nIt's good that most of these articles are about general topics, such as \"biology,\" which are less culturally biased.  And, it is inevitable that this list be SOMEWHAT Eurocentric and even Anglocentric, because the world is that way right now (and most Egyptians are not too familiar with China, for example, but they know the US). However, this list is very extreme.  Even the non-Europeans that are there are present because they are known in the West.  Historical importance should matter more. </br>\n\nThe following are my (annotated) suggestions for the article.

This list is easier to make less Eurocentric, it seems.) </br>\n\n'''Revolutionaries''' (This category is very weak.  Truly important revolutionaries were generally also political leaders.  Couldn't these figures be put under \"political leaders\"?  And I don't think Mother Theresa is necessary for, say, the Hausa wikipedia.) </br>\nRosa Luxemburg was a more important revolutionary than a thinker - which is where she is now - and more significant than Emma Goldman and Florence Nightingale, who are Anglocentric picks)\n\n(A couple other possibilities overall: Ibn Hanbal [Muslim theologian], Chandragupta II [Indian monarch of the Gupta dynasty], Xuanzang [Chinese Buddhist traveler], Ibn abd al-Wahhab [Saudi theologian], Kabir [Hindi poet], Sundiata Keita [founder of the Mali empire], Hong Xiuquan [Taiping rebel], al-Mutannabi [most popular Arabic poet], etc.  Very unfortunately, some of these world-historical figures are not even well covered in English, so I will leave them out.)\n\nI can very much justify these figures in terms of deletion of other Eurocentric figures.  Ibn Khaldun is more significant than Herodotus, let alone Giordano Bruno.  The Wahhabi movement (of Saudi Arabia) is far more influential than Francis of Assisi, especially today (and the excuse for the Eurocentrism of this list is that the West is more influential today).  Harun al-Rashid is far more significant than Mussolini, Ben-Gurion, or Bismarck.  Suleiman was more significant than Charlemagne (whose empire was an impoverished corner of the world at the time).  Kalidasa is far more significant than Jose Saramango.  And so on.\n\nThose \"activists\" at the end are somewhat dubious.  Apparently the goal is to increase the number of women, but that seems to be happening at the expense of non-white peoples, who were in fact extraordinarily significant in world history.  Florence Nightingale was not.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to radically change the list, just to make it slightly less Eurocentric.  I don't know much about sub-saharan Africa, and Africa's lack of written culture prior to colonialism probably makes it harder to include historical figures from that region.  Nonetheless, the near total lack of African and Southeast Asian figures on this list is still a problem.  And where are the black Americans?\n\nI am going to wait a bit for a response, but I will start (slowly) adding these figures to the list soon.\n[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 02:33, 31 March 2009 (UTC)\n:I think the challenge isn't \"who to add\" but \"who to remove\" to make room for them. Some people you mentioned were previously in the list but were pruned out. The biography section was huge compared with the other sections and greatly reduced some months ago. The best way to keep the list at a 1000 articles is mention who you want to replace for each article you want to add. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 05:54, 31 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n::OK, I did start a bit.  I removed Sappho, Henrik Ibsen, Horace, and Omar Khayyam.  Omar Khayyam was easy, because he is Persian, and Ferdowsi's Shahnama is the Persian national epic.  Khayyam is mainly well-known in the West as a poet because of Fitzgerald's (inaccurate) translation.  Persian culture is well-known in India and the Islamic world, and the Shahnama is very much beloved in those regions too; I put the epic under poetry.  Sappho and Horace had to be removed because of an excess of Greek/Latin works.  I can't imagine that non-western readers would want so many before other worthy writers (I've reduced it to 4 from 6).  It's much better to add two Indian writers, Kalidasa and Tagore, since India was previously unrepresented.  Tagore is the Bengali national writer (and the first Asian Nobel Prize winner), and Kalidasa is considered the greatest Sanskrit writer - Sanskrit being the language of India for thousands of years.  Lastly, I removed Ibsen.  Ibsen's role in western culture is relatively minor and not nearly as great as the multi-volume novel Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese literature.  This novel has brought about the Chinese scholarly discipline called [[:en:Redology|Redology]].  I placed it under the novels, next to 1001 Nights.\n\n::I'll keep working later.  But the point is that figures who are relatively minor in the West and not well-known globally should be displaced by non-western figures; the West is so overrepresented, and the rest of the world has plenty of figures of huge importance, particularly in the pre-modern era.  The West was not dominant then, so there is no reason to privilege Western figures from that time.[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 06:29, 31 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::I agree with MarsRover.

It will remain that way; the vast majority of figures will be European or American.  I'm just adding the most egregious exclusions.  And it's not a matter always of simply \"fitting them in\" because many of those excluded are more significant than any number of those who were included.  Here's a clear example that I forgot.  [[:en:Al-Ghazali|Al-Ghazali]] is Islam's most significant medieval theologian, and his role in Islam is certainly greater than St. Francis, Mother Theresa or Giordano Bruno in Christianity.  So really, any of these could be eliminated.\n\nI have added my removals to the page where those are listed.  Below I'll list a few more removals with rationales.\n\n[[:en:Al-Ghazali|Al-Ghazali]] for Giordano Bruno </br>\n[[:en:Ibn Khaldun|Ibn Khaldun]] replaces Avicenna on the \"thinker\" list </br>\nAvicennna is moved to the scientist list and replaces Pascal (Avicenna wrote the standard medical work lasting for hundreds of years, as well as numerous other fields) </br>\n[[:en:Ibn Battuta|Ibn Battuta]] replaces von Humboldt among explorers (Ibn Battuta was a greater traveler than Marco Polo, in the same era.) </br>\n[[:en:Chanakya|Chanakya]] replaces Emile Durkheim (thinkers).  (Chanakya was the prime minister of the first [[:en:Maurya|Maurya]] king, who established the first pan-Indian empire.  Chanakya then wrote India's most important works of political philosophy.  He has been compared to Macchiavelli. The only Indian thinker on the list, despite India's incredible influence in China and esp Southeast Asia...) </br>\n[[:en:Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman the Magnificent]] replaces Mussolini.  Suleiman expanded a giant, extremely powerful empire and gave it its laws, and the Ottoman Empire dominated the Mediterranean for centuries.  Mussolini was the incompetent ruler of a weak country for about two decades.  There are already so many WWII era leaders, and Mussolini did not even make a big impact in WWII. </br>\n[[:en:Ashoka|Ashoka]] replaces Hirohito.  Hirohito was more a witness to history than a leader in it.  Ashoka was in large part responsible for the rise of Buddhism to the status of a world religion, as well as determining the political history of India.  He ruled probably the largest Indian empire. </br>\n[[:en:Harun al-Rashid|Harun al-Rashid]] is added to the leaders list, and Emma Goldman is removed from the activists.  As much as I love Emma, she's a relatively minor American anarchist.  Harun al-Rashid was the most powerful Islamic caliph, ruling an empire from the Atlantic to western China.  He was even made a central figure in the Arabian Nights, so he's possibly more famous even in the west, let alone the Islamic world. </br>\n[[:en:Hokusai|Hokusai]] replaces I. M. Pei, who seems to be the \"multicultural\" choice of the list.  Pei's article is short even in English, whereas Hokosai attracts more attention and made a much bigger impact, in both Japan and the West. </br>\n[[:en:Sinan|Sinan]] replaces Donatello.  Donatello was an early Renaissance sculptor with a limited impact.  Sinan is the most famous Muslim architect, and his buildings still stand throughout the former Ottoman empire.  The article says: \"He was, during a period of fifty years, responsible for the construction or the supervision of every major building in the Ottoman Empire\" at the height of its power.\n\nOK, that's all for now.  Total, those are only a few out of 1000.[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 20:39, 31 March 2009 (UTC)\n\n\nAnother point.  There is a tendency that should be avoided here.  It is common in the western (Anglophone) imagination to hype the importance of the \"bad\" or ridiculous leaders of other countries.  Most people probably think that Mussolini is more significant than Garibaldi, who created Italy as a country.  Cixi is on this list, but not Sun Yat Sen.  Hirohito was there, but not Meiji, even though Hirohito's Japan generally followed the new imperialist path established by Meiji's Japan (neither had much power anyway).  Part of this is natural since Hirohito and Mussolini were the heads of state in wars against the US and UK.  But there's also a tendency to focus on leaders who are the butts of jokes and fascinating in their barbarity (e.g., the venality of Cixi).\n\nThis is a long lead up to one point (for now).  I'm replacing Cixi with Sun Yat Sen.  Yale prof. Jonathan Spence's standard work on China - The Search for Modern China - lists Cixi in its index only 6 times, but Sun Yat Sen is listed perhaps 50 times.  She just isn't that important.\n[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 08:00, 1 April 2009 (UTC)\n:Thank you for documenting your changes...  it's becoming a little difficult to keep the lists in the various wikipedias maintained.

Well, maybe not the war itself, but what came of it: it ended the age where religion was a cause for war between Europeans, signaled the end of Spain as a world power, the negotiations at the end of it was the birth of modern diplomatics, and it created a system of thinking that would live on at least until the Congress of Vienna, or even until WWI.

Should there only be one article relating to Christianity?  This is a religion followed by almost 2 billion people.  It's not a unified singular phenomenon, but rather a complex tradition.  If anything, Christianity is fine and MORE articles on Islam should be added, e.g., Sunnism/Shiism/Sufism.  And your example of an African leader to add is understandable, but probably not a good one.  I certainly agree that the pre-modern Malian leaders would be the best pre-modern Africans to add - but look at how little attention this leader has attracted even in English.  However, SOMETHING about Malian history could be added.  Perhaps the [[en:Mali Empire]] article could be added to the medieval section of history?  That's a very nice article right now.\n:::::Are you seriously suggesting that the Spanish and French articles be removed?  Spanish and French are the official languages of more countries than any language but English.  That is really crazy.  Likewise, Hindi is quite distinct from Sanskrit.

Marx famously said, \"I am not a Marxist.\"  In scholarly literature, anything relating to Marx is called \"Marxian\" rather than Marxist.  Marxism is a tradition of thought starting with Marx's successors and attaining great importance as the de facto religion of the Soviet bloc.

Or rather, I did, but they were reverted because they were too controversial after the discussion, I think we have more of a consensus on how this section should be changed.  No one has disputed that the article is too Eurocentric, the only question is which articles should be put in.  So, I'll propose some changes again.\n\n# [[en:Louis Armstrong|Louis Armstrong]] replaces Hendrix.  Louis Armstrong was the pioneer of jazz, the first global American genre, whereas Hendrix came as one of multiple 60's rock stars.  Hendrix is a very popular black musician among white Americans, but that is neither here nor there.  Armstrong changed history, and there are already some rock musicians on the list. </br>\n# [[en:Musical instrument|Musical instruments]] replaces [[en:Robert Schumann|Schumann, Robert]]. Having an article on musical instruments is allows for less Eurocentrism, because you can talk about various instruments from various times and places. </br>\n# [[en:Edith Piaf|Edith Piaf]] for [[en:Hector Berlioz|Hector Berlioz]].  This section is so heavy on 19th century musicians and it needs some more 20th century musicians, especially non-Anglophones.  Edith Piaf was more famous in her day than Berlioz in his anyway.  She is maybe the best known non-Anglophone singer of the 20th century and is a national hero in France.\n\nNow, I don't know where to go from here.  I will let Elvis stand because he is just too well known.  I don't think people liked my suggestions like [[en:Vladimir Vysotsky]] or [[en:Music of India|Indian Music]] -  which attempted to make the section less Eurocentric.  I could add [[en:Vedas]], [[en:Torah]], [[en:Bible]] and [[en:Quran]] to replace these the four music articles listed below, or I could add some non-Western music articles.  Personally, I would like to do the latter.  There is already so much on this list about religion, but little about non-western pop culture.  My suggestions would be [[en:Vladimir Vysotsky]], [[en:Umm Kulthum]], and then [[en:Tango_(dance)|Tango]] and [[en:Salsa_(dance)|Salsa]] under \"Dance\" (or maybe Latin American Music and Music of India).  In any case, let me know what you think about the music section (and the possible addition of a section on religious texts).\n\n[[en:Johannes Brahms|Brahms, Johannes]] </br>\n[[en:The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones, The]] </br>\n[[en:Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana, Bed\u0159ich]] </br>\n[[en:Anton Bruckner|Bruckner, Anton]] </br>\n\nSome more changes that were mentioned above, but which I now want to act on: </br>\n# [[en:Galen]] for [[en:Hippocrates]].  I can say categorically that Galen was the most influential medical scientist/doctor of antiquity, not Hippocrates. </br>\n# [[en:Cai Lun]] for Fibonacci. If you want to fit in Fibonacci or Fibonacci numbers somewhere, try it.  The ancient inventor of paper is more significant than the medieval '''transmitter''' of some mathematical concepts to Europe.  If Fibonacci is just that important, perhaps Pythagorus should be removed (because \"some have questioned the scope of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy,\" as the wiki article says). </br>\n# [[en:Tang Dynasty]] replaces Haile Selassie. There were already two other 20th century African nationalists on the list, so I thought that Selassie is probably redundant. The Tang Dynasty was probably the height of Chinese power, and it has an excellent article. I remember fondly reading this history when I was in school. Selassie has Rastafarianism, but that is rather odd. --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 21:54, 11 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:Hm, more possibilities to replace those four.  [[en:Enka]], [[en:Fado]], [[en:Son (music)]], [[en:Flamenco]] or [[en:Samba]] as musical genres that are non-western.  Well, Flamenco is Spanish, but still.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 00:26, 13 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n::No comments at all?  Well, I would like to finish my edits to this list sometime soon (assuming that happens... and maybe I could help on the translations.)  So, I will go ahead with some of these.  Here's what I did:\n# [[en:Galen]] replaces [[en:Hippocrates]].\n# [[en:Cai Lun]] replaces [[en:Pythagorus]].  I thought it would be most fair to exchange an ancient for an ancient.  Pythagorus is more mythical than anything else, and even the Pythagorean theorem pre-dated him.\n# [[en:Tang Dynasty]] replaces Haile Selassie.\nHere is the music part.  Since people objected to my non-Western musicians, I decided the replace the excess classical composers with two non-Western musicians and two music genres that are somewhat more diverse.\n# [[en:Louis Armstrong|Louis Armstrong]] replaces Hendrix.\n# [[en:Edith Piaf|Edith Piaf]] replaces [[en:Hector Berlioz|Hector Berlioz]].\n# [[en:Flamenco]] replaces [[en:Robert Schumann|Schumann, Robert]].\n# [[en:Samba]] replaces [[en:The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones, The]].\n# [[en:Umm Kulthum]] replaces [[en:Bed\u0159ich Smetana|Smetana, Bed\u0159ich]].  As the German Wikipedia article states, her status in the Arab world is similar to the Beatles in the Western world.\n# [[en:Vladimir Vysotsky]] replaces [[en:Anton Bruckner|Bruckner, Anton]].\n\nI suppose Vysotsky and Umm Kulthum may still not be consensus choices, since Arab and Soviet cultures are not exactly well-known in the West.  But as a measure of their importance, the articles of both state that at least 1 million people attended their funerals.  These outpourings could be compared to the death of John Lennon.  Let me know if you have an objection, but I am going to enter this into the list so that I can move on.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 03:27, 15 April 2009 (UTC)[\n\n== To be consistant ==\n\nIf we have [[en:Domestic sheep]] should we have [[en:Domestic pig]] (instead of [[en:Pig]])? --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 21:46, 11 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:I'm not sure.  If you type in [[en:sheep]] on Wikipedia, the article \"Domestic Sheep\" comes up.  This may be because the sheep that most people are interested in are all domestic, and there are few non-domestic sheep.  There doesn't appear to be an article simply called \"sheep\" at all.  In contrast, many wild pigs are very famous, e.g., [[en:warthog]].  My two cents.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 21:58, 11 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n::[[en:Wild Boar]] is a example.

But I know what you mean. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 22:21, 11 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Religion ==\n\nI want to make some changes to the religion section.  For example, I think [[en:Spirituality]] should be removed in favor in specific forms of spirituality.  This is a good example of an overview article which isn't very interesting.  The English version has some basic, New Agey information and that's it.  In contrast, [[en:Sufism]] and [[en:Yoga]] have great articles that are already in more Wikipedias than [[en:Spirituality]].  To make room, I would remove [[en:Indian philosophy]].  Yoga is actually the most famous spiritual form of Indian philosophy and while I like overview articles as a way of including non-western cultures, the Indian philosophy article hadn't really attracted much attention, unfortunately.\n\nI also want to remove [[en:Ali]], who I added to the list of religious figures, in favor of [[en:Shia Islam]] as a subset of Islam.  Ali is the central figure in Shia Islam, so his story is a part of that broader story. For various reasons that I could go into, it's not necessary to include [[en:Sunni Islam]] (That is the majority denomination, so Sunnism has few practices that are distinct from Islam generally, in contrast to Shiism).  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 09:34, 12 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:I'm thinking about eliminating those philosophy overview articles altogether.  I will not go ahead and do it yet, but I am thinking about removing [[en:Islamic philosophy]] and adding [[en:Zen]] under spirituality (since Islam is already well represented among the thinkers and in the religious section), and replacing [[en:Chinese philosophy]] with [[en:Zhu Xi]].  I brought him up before, but didn't add him because his name isn't very well-known.  That is still a problem, but he is the founder of Neo-Confucianism which dominated Asia for centuries as a de facto state religion (His article says: \"From 1313 to 1905, Zhu Xi's commentaries on the Four Books formed the basis of civil service examinations in China\").  He philosophized the [[en:qi]] (aka \"chi\") and the [[en:taiji]] (normally spelled \"taichi\"), which '''are''' well-known concepts.  The obvious alternative to Zhu Xi is [[en:Mencius]].  Well, I will consider about this.  Any thoughts? --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 10:11, 12 April 2009 (UTC)\n:: I agree with the above points. I think an article about philosophy is fine, but a \"_____ philosophy\" leaves me a bit cold. I'd much rather see a prominent figure from that philosophy. Ali and Zhu Xi are great examples which should yield more dynamic articles. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 14:37, 13 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::OK, well, here is what I will do.  I think the consensus is that overview articles (like \"____\" philosophy) are not as useful as specific concepts.  Therefore, I will remove Chinese and Islamic philosophy, in favor of [[en:Zen]] under \"Spiritual practices\" and [[en:Shiva]] under religious figures.  Islamic culture is already far better represented on this list than India, and Shiva is, according to the English article, often seen as the \"supreme God\" of Hinduism (though only sometimes).  I wanted to include Zhu Xi, but I just think the name isn't famous enough outside of Asia, whereas Zen is.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 01:36, 15 April 2009 (UTC)\n\nI think \"Agnosticism\" should be added to that list. --- [[Special:Contributions/92.204.79.106|92.204.79.106]] 23:35, 26 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n== A Proposal: Current Events and Recent History ==\n\nWhile I now feel much more satisfied with the article generally, I still have one more idea.  I've noticed that some of the most popular articles are not listed here, mainly because they are too recent.  For example, I imagine that every Wikipedia should have something about Obama, Bush, and the conflict in Israel/Palestine.  Why not have a section for \"Current Events and Recent History\"?\n\nSo, my proposal is to take out 10 cities and 10 countries, and add a new section at the end called \"Current Events and Recent History\" or something like that.  As the section on countries already says, the countries listed are just some basics, and ultimately all countries should be included.  In addition, obviously, only the most world-historical events and leaders of recent years and decades could be added to this new section.  Here are some ideas:\n# Obama\n# George W. Bush\n# Bill Clinton\n# Ronald Reagan\n# Thatcher\n# Sarkozy\n# Gorbachev\n# Putin\n# [[en:Deng Xiaoping]]\n# [[en:Lula]]  (or [[en:Hugo Chavez]])\n# Suharto\n# Indira Gandhi\n# Nasser\n# Israel-Palestine Conflict (or Arab-Israeli Conflict or Yasser Arafat)\n# September 11 attacks\n# [[en:Late 2000s recession]]\n# Saddam Hussein\n# [[en:Iranian Revolution]]\n# [[en:May 1968 in France]]\n# [[en:Prague Spring]]\n\nSome more...\n# War in Darfur\n# German Reunification/Helmut Kohl\n\nA couple events, like [[en:Vietnam War]] and [[en:Cold War]] are already included in world history.  Anyway, this is just an idea.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 05:54, 15 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:We discussed this already. I still strongly feel that popularity isn't a measure of importance and that many events that seem crucial now will soon fade into obscurity. Like George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, most probably. Only future can tell who/what is world-historical and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Besides me feeling that your list is out of this page's scope, it is also strongly western-centric and non-western entries are mostly of local importance. All in all, I strongly oppose the idea. --[[Special:Contributions/193.2.89.2|193.2.89.2]] 07:11, 15 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n::I agree. It will open up ton of debates having current leaders.

It best to let some time pass to see if they are thought of  as important by the historians. -[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 10:35, 15 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::OK, sure.  Such a list would certainly complicate things.  I only added it for its obvious usefulness.  All Wikipedias will want an article on Obama, Gorbachev, and September 11 for example.  This is not Eurocentric... it's just a fact of world politics.  Bush was more powerful than any Chinese emperor or any European king ever, in terms of world dominance.  He certainly isn't popular.  You could call him the conqueror of Iraq and Afghanistan, and he had troops stationed all over the world as well as political control over countries where no troops were.  Regardless of what \"the future\" thinks, any Wikipedia here and now will want this info in the here and now because it does matter.\n:::Nonetheless, yeah, this is a complicated idea and perhaps outside the scope the list.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 22:28, 16 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n::::While I don't insist on this list, I think that just as Wikipedias will be and should be at least somewhat Eurocentric, so too should they be oriented more toward the present than \"overall importance\" might allow.  This is how Wikipedia in fact works, and while this tendency should be tempered, it shouldn't be eliminated.  For us today, information of George W. Bush is far more important than Charlemagne, who is merely of some historical interest (and Bush was, in any case, a greater conqueror and more powerful leader, if foolish).  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 22:52, 16 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::::Having [[en:George W. Bush|George W. Bush]] in the list will reopen an old debate. Even when he was President people kept wanting to remove him. IMHO, we should have the current leaders of say the four most important countries. But if you add Obama, the argument will be what has he done so far to deserve to be on the list. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 04:36, 17 April 2009 (UTC)  \n\n::Well, then the future can hold their own discussions about articles that need to be added to or removed from this list when the time to remove someone comes.

She's also more famous than Shitao.  The Shitao article even in English isn't very good yet, let alone other languages.  Chinese painting is extraordinarily significant, but is there another painter who is better known?  We should be able to be both non-Eurocentric and to be able to choose 100% world-renowned figures.\n# Sure, Hafez is good, but I really think [[en:Rumi]] is a better choice.  Rumi is more famous and his followers founded the Mevlevi Sufi order.\n# The problem with Laozi is that he probably never existed.  But yeah, he is the most famous Taoist...\n# Why remove Shiva?  I had [[en:Chanakya]] under the thinkers and he was brought to the economists.  I will undo this.  He is not primarily an economist (The wiki article just implies this awkwardly).  While I don't want to remove Shiva, Adi Shankara does seem significant.\n# Sure, Sima Qian is significant, but I wanted one Chinese inventor on the list and Cai Lun is certainly famous.  Will there by no Chinese scientists?  China dominated scientific advancement up to c. 1500...\n# Simone de Beauvoir simply cannot be removed.  She is the key feminist thinker, and feminism is profoundly affecting our lives  (Remember, this list is also necessarily biased toward the present rather than the past; not every century is going to get equal time).  Zhu Xi is still significant and there should be more than one Chinese thinker.  But why not remove another?  My suggestion: Let's remove the [[en:morality]] article.  It's partially redundant bc of [[en:ethics]].  Morality is different in that it deals with modes of behavior, but morality as such is uninteresting (as the article shows; it's a short article with little info).  People are ''really'' interested in specific forms of morality, e.g., sexual morality, etc.\n# I definitely support this one.  Either Cyrus or Darius are both far more significant than Cleopatra, who did not do anything.  She is just famous as a symbol of women's sexual power.  This is not a very feminist symbol, either.  There are already multiple Romans on the list, but no Persians.\n# Kangxi is probably more significant than Rosa Luxemburg.  However, she was the leader of the German Revolution of 1918 and a major Marxist thinker.  And she's a woman.

His relative lack of fame is still problematic to me.  One strategy I like to use on this list is not always to add non-western people, but sometimes non-western ideas or concepts.  The west is more individualistic than others, so I feel like even the idea of long lists of \"great men\" is slightly eurocentric.  For example, I think it was a good idea to add Zen before Zhu Xi, because Zen was a whole philosophical school and a collaborative effort (Still want Zhu Xi though).  Likewise, Shiva has been a locus of Hindu religion that is more important than any one Hindu thinker.  However, I still think Ada Shankara is an good addition, just not as good as Shiva.  And Nehru cannot be removed, since he is the founder of the Republic of India, soon to be the world's most populous country.\n\nI relent on the point about Cai Lun.  His biography is just too spare.  I removed him and added Sima Qian (under Historians).  I also removed morality and added Zhu Xi.  Plus, I rearranged some of the sections that had been rearranged among the \"thinkers\".  Took Adam Smith from philosophers and put him among economists, took Chanakya from Economists and added him and Macchiavelli under Political Scientists.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 00:25, 21 April 2009 (UTC)\n\nOne thing, what if we removed Dali instead of Frida Kahlo?  Dali is perhaps less famous than Frida, he's one of many Spaniards on the list, his artistic style is somewhat similar, etc.  There are even two Spanish modernists on the list, Dali and Picasso...

Dewey Decimal Classification sorts biographical publications under the topic that most pertains to biographees' claims to fame. Such topics presumably tend to be more general, and to have broader implications (hence more embedded links), than life-and-works articles. A biography, after all, is a ''form of presentation,'' not a discussion of a topic. Instead of [[en:Frida Kahlo]] (if the topic for which she's known is all that important), the list could have [[en:Painting in Mexico]], or [[en:The Arts of Mexico]], or [[en:The Arts of Central America]], or [[en:The Arts of Latin America]], or whatever; instead of [[en:Simone der Beauvoir]], the list could have [[en:Feminism]] or some similar topic that would be much larger than the woman in question.

For example, of nearly 3 million English Wikipedia article there is ''no'' article on \"Painting in Mexico\" whatsoever, or even \"Mexican Art\".  For me personally, [[en:German literature]] generally is more important than [[en:Goethe]].  And yet, the actually existing overview of German literature is nothing but a list of links to articles on a few styles and numerous individual writers. The article on Goethe is quite good - even though few Americans have heard of him (the majority of English Wikipedia contributors).  It's also been translated into roughly 3x the number of languages. In helping shape this list, my goal has been to respond partly to what has already been written, rather than re-writing Wikipedia from scratch.  To some extent, the articles that are written reflect the needs of the readers.\n::It should surely be said also that the point of an encyclopedia is to inform.  So it's quite right that there are some figures on the list that you may not have heard of.  If you don't know much about Islamic history, you won't have heard of [[en:Umar]].  What overview would he fit under... well, most likely [[en:Rashidun]], which even fewer people have heard of, and its article is shorter than and inferior to the article on Umar.\n::Since these overview articles are so unpopular and poorly written, the biographies are the only alternative.  Many famous topics, like feminism, are certainly already on the list. I think the practice of this list relates closely also to how Wikipedia is used. I personally as a college student and now a graduate student use biographical articles all the time to get background on various subjects. Wikipedia - and encyclopedias generally - are different from libraries.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 06:20, 23 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::That's all well put, and one can't disagree with any of it, except to point out the basic fact of its elitism: that self-selected experts have decided which thousand topics encyclopedias should cover. Two kinds of awkwardness arise from this fact.\n:::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Some of the experts aren't experts, and the resulting list is necessarily a bunglesome farrago (albeit one that's improving over time, as additional minds contribute). The survival of Smetana for so long among the set of European composers attests to that, as do the members of the present set: ''J. S. Bach, The Beatles, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Handel, Mahler, Mozart, Puccini, Schubert, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Vivaldi, Vysotsky, Wagner.'' The inclusion of a few of these is laughable. (Vysotsky? Really?) Many are problematic\u2014the preference for Chopin, for example, over Schumann: Schumann composed equally compelling piano works, but has the ''additional'' notability of having composed important songs & symphonies & an opera, and having founded an influential musical journal, which he edited and in which he published reviews and articles of aesthetic criticism. If one had to choose the seventeen (and why that number?) European composers whose musical achievements were the most influential or representative of their times, a poll of the most influential professional music historians would almost certainly agree on most of these eleven, listed in chronological order: ''Perotinus, Machaut, Dufay, Iosquin des Prez, Palestrina, Monteverdi, J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Wagner, Schoenberg, Stravinsky.'' Yet seven of them don't make the current cut! If one had the freedom to include their most notable contemporaries or near-contemporaries, one could add Leoninus to Perotinus, Handel to Bach, Mozart to Beethoven, and Verdi to Wagner. But why bother? It might be better to reduce the list to ten (striking Wagner), and thereby making room for influential musicians from the rest of the world. \u00a7 Note that by starting the chronology in the thirteenth century, we've ignored a few highly influential musicians, like [[en:Guido of Arezzo]], but their effects could be accommodated in more general articles, one of which, [[en:Gregorian chant]], or, even more generally, an article (to be written?) on the (historically related?) cantillation of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, might well want to be among the favored thousand.\n:::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The project of the thousand important pages is a top-down enterprise: people at the top (the experts) dictate what people farther down (the less learned) should know. In this, it's no less old-fashioned than dead-tree encyclopedias. Is it possible to construct a bottom-up list? Can the current state of wikitechnology find the thousand most-searched-for pages? Those would be the topics that the world really wants to know about. To the extent that the whole wiki enterprise is involved in marketing (making available to the public a product that the public wants), that would seem to be a reasonable way to go, as soon as technology permits it. \u2014JWL, [[Special:Contributions/71.178.66.126|71.178.66.126]] 19:11, 24 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n::::Regarding the question of whether you \"find the thousand most-searched-for pages\".

[[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 14:05, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n\nI say, ''far'' better to exclude the medieval than to exclude the non-Western.  I have been actively editing these lists, and I did remove Schumann among others and added Vysotsky, [[en:Umm Kalthoum]], Edith Piaf, etc.  It's valuable to question that (no one did when I brought it up on the discussion page), but on principle the list cannot be purely Western classical composers, whose time has in any case long passed.  Vysotsky and Umm Kalthoum's cultural positions in Eastern Europe and the Arab world respectively are roughly similar to that of the Beatles in America and the UK, particularly in the case of Umm Kalthoum, and they both have political significance, unlike most classical composers.  The list when I found it was full of 19th century German(ic) composers who may matter to the world's classical music aficianados, but they aren't the whole story of world music.  Perhaps using a better tack, I added some more diverse ''genres'', like [[en:hip hop]], [[en:samba]] and [[en:flamenco]].  But back to the biographies, 19th century Europeans are still in the majority. <br />\nIf anything, these lists should be biased ''against'' obscure medieval composers, no matter how significant, and biased in favor of important recent musicians.  Vivaldi is \"better\" or more innovative musically than [[en:the Beatles]], but which one is needed by readers more?  However, it should not be totally biased against non-Anglophone musicians, because these musicians aren't forgotten at all - they are in fact hugely famous and important, just not for Americans or Brits. <br />\nThe ideal would not be to have one expert on European classical music, but rather a few musicologists who could come together to combine contemporary popular music, non-Western musical forms and Western classical music into one good list.  We don't have that, so we make do, insofar as we believe that there should be a list like this. <br />\nAs for some of the specific composers, Dufay, Perotin and Josquin des Prez certainly have not been written about very much in non-English wikipedias, so it would be quite awkward to add them.  I'd guess that only a tiny handful of people has ever heard of them in any country.  Perotin's article is only about 6 paragraphs long even in English, for example.  Monteverdi has been written about, though, so he should perhaps be added.  I'll let you respond to my comments first before discussing more. --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 22:31, 24 April 2009 (UTC)\n:As usual with such lists, the ''criteria for inclusion'' govern the choices. An obvious criterion (obvious at least to one conversant with the history of music) is historical influence, and its prime question would be \"Which composers have most affected the history of music?\" And augmenting that: \"Which composers best represent an era of profound historical influence?\" Given those questions (but once again only in regard to European music, and leaving aside the question of non-Western music), the inclusion of Brahms, Chopin, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Mahler, Puccini, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Vivaldi, and especially Vysotsky, to the exclusion of Perotinus, Machaut, Dufay, Iosquin des Prez, Palestrina, Monteverdi, and Schoenberg doesn't make sense.<br>\n:But of course there are other ways of making sense, and \"modern popularity\" could be one of them. That brings us back to the bottom-up process. \"What do people want to know?\" is utterly different from \"What should people know?\" That's why it might be useful to discover which topics people are actually searching for.<br>\n::On this point, thanks to a hint from MarsRover (above), see the new threads I've started below. JWL, [[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 14:47, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:A third angle\u2014in regard now to the whole list, not just the European composers\u2014could be to study the linking that already exists within the English wikipedia, which has enough substantial articles that patterns among the links could serve as a criterion for finding the thousand most important articles. Presumably, for example, since Beethoven was historically a more influential & exemplary composer than, say, his near-contemporary Hummel, a huge encyclopedia will have more articles that have links to [[:en:Beethoven]] than to [[:en:Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. You can probably see where this idea leads: find the thousand most-linked-to articles, and those will necessarily be the conceptual hubs around which the most sought constellations of topics revolve.<br>\n:Side note, back to music: there's no good reason to include Vivaldi but to exclude (for example) Telemann, a similarly productive (but not especially innovative or influential) composer; or to include Chopin but to exclude Domenico Scarlatti, a similarly productive keyboard composer. And Mozart is often my favorite composer, but to include him, once you've admitted you must have Beethoven, is a waste of a valuable slot\u2014and this example opens up another set of choices: if you're going to include Mozart even though you've already got Beethoven, you can't exclude Schuetz just because you've already got Monteverdi. Which you haven't yet got, of course. :) JWL, [[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 14:05, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n::Ultimately, the criteria for inclusion have to be a compromise between what people want to know and what they should know.  In fact, my normal method has been to choose ''only'' those figures or concepts that are ''both'' important and in high demand.  There is really no other way of going about this.  I'm a PhD student in Islamic history, and even though I consider [[en:Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] to have had far more important effects than the conqueror [[en:Saladin]] (especially on today's world), popularity has caused me to allow the latter to stand.  For example, Celine Dion is nearly as popular as Mozart, and both are worlds more popular than Perotinus, yet which one of those three would make sense on this list?  Your exclusion of Mozart is a very obvious sign that something is wrong with your criteria.--[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 15:56, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:::A secondary criterion (not mentioned) is that no epoch should have more than one representative. For the period of, say, 1750 to 1827, that representative must be Beethoven. See next remark (below). JWL, [[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 17:02, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n::Mozart has been very influential and is very important, and he is in very great demand on Wikipedia.  Perotinus was important, but is not in demand.  Adding him to the list would be something like re-writing Wikipedia, since his existing articles are so pitiful and need to be re-written.  Adding Celine Dion is in demand, but is not important.  This list cannot be filled with Celine Dions or Perotinuses.  Simply put, you include Mozart because of his modern popularity and his huge role in modern culture.--[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 15:56, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:::\"Popularity\" (or perhaps better put, \"respect\") isn't a creation of the year 2009. Throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, Beethoven was the artist who loomed large\u2014indeed, probably largest of all, The Most Important Composer Of All Time (tm). Brahms wasn't popularly called a second Mozart, after all; nor was his first symphony hailed as Mozart's forty-second (as it was Beethoven's tenth); nor did the three B's (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms) include Mozart. In Paine Hall at Harvard, the names of the most famous/influential composers parade from the back left around the wall to the back right, and guess whose name was contrived to stand in the middle, directly above center stage: Beethoven. In Symphony Hall, Boston, the name of one, and only one, composer stands above the stage: Beethoven. The best way of accommodating Mozart\u2014and Haydn! and a host of others!\u2014might be to abandon the biographies altogether (as suggested at the top) and cite the article on [[:en:Classical period (music)]]. JWL, [[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 17:02, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n::The same cannot be said for even Schuetz and Monteverdi.\n::As for some of your lists below, I think they could well be useful, but what you have so far isn't very useful.  Those lists don't yet tell us much about what musicians/composers should be listed.  The only other thing that I would add is that popularity is not always reflected by what has been written.  My point here has been to make this less Eurocentric, and Wikipedia has some built in Eurocentric biases.  People from developed countries have better Internet access and so are more likely to write articles, even though people from poor countries still use Wikipedia  (The Spanish Wikipedia has the second highest number of \"contributors\" and yet far more articles have been written in German and French).  So, beyond popularity and importance in the West, I would add that importance in other cultures is the third criterium, to counteract the inherent bias of Wikipedia.\n::Regarding Vysotsky, the disagreement here turns on the fact that I do ''not'' consider Vysotsky to be a \"Western\" musician.  He is certainly not popular in the \"West\" (ie, Western Europe and North America) or even well-known.  He is popular in the former Soviet Union, which we in the West have been utterly cut off from and implacably hostile to (esp in the US).\n::If you are familiar with non-Western musics, let's consider replacing him with another non-Western musician, perhaps from a culture that has been more neglected on the list than Soviet culture.  I just had a hard time doing that.  One seemingly easy choice would be [[en:Fela Kuti]], who is one of my favorite musicians and as big in West Africa as Vysotsky in the USSR and the Beatles in the US/UK.  However, he's not particularly in demand on Wikipedia, it seems (eg, translations).  The same goes for the Pakistani musician [[en:Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]].  Ravi Shankar could be a possibility, but his Western popularity makes me more skeptical: is he a Western phenomenon or was he really hugely popular in India?  I don't know enough about India so I can't say, though I would be very open to an Indian musician.  In any case, Vysotsky is more in demand on Wikipedia than any of these musicians.  So, even if a musician is important, let's make sure we choose ones that have an established presence on Wikipedia.\n::As for Vivaldi or Chopin, they and others can be on the chopping block if you like (I certainly didn't add them).  You definitely know more about classical music than others here, so go ahead.  It will help to check the popularity of various composers though.  I usually look at the list of translations on the side of the articles to compare.  If you want to use a more \"scientific\" method, go ahead.  The real question, though, is how to include non-Western musics.  I mean, this list is just a starting point, so if it has Vivaldi and not Telemann, it's not a big deal.  A failure to include non-Western musics generally, though, would be a bigger problem.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 15:56, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:::To make the musical section of the list less Western, I'd cut the unnecessary composers and, for starters, consider adding some general topics, perhaps: for Africa, [[:en:Music of Africa]] (a thin article, which needs extensive filling out); for China, [[:en:Peking opera]]; for India, [[:en:Music of India]] (which needs extensive filling out); for Indonesia, [[:en:Gamelan]]; for Japan, [[:en:Noh]] or [[:en:Kabuki]]. For European music (again if the biographies, or most of them, were cut), add [[:en:Gregorian chant]]\u2014maybe the most popular European genre of all time, if popularity is regarded as extending across more than a millennium\u2014and [[:en:Chamber music]] and [[:en:Concerto]]. To cover musical instruments worldwide, there should be a loooong article on organology, for which the present [[:en:Organology]] is a pitiful squeak, not the full-throated roar that it should be. JWL. [[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 17:19, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n::::Well, I did have the thought of adding a number of those articles, and I even briefly added \"Music of India\" and \"Music of Africa\" (This wasn't a popular idea, though).  But as you can already see, none of these articles are yet truly important parts of Wikipedia.  All of this constitutes basically re-writing Wikipedia and going strongly against what people want and use.  Yes, people ''should'' know about [[en:Carnatic music]], but I'm not sure that they are that interested; Ravi Shankar would probably be a better choice.  I also like this sort of scholarly approach to things, but I've been told time and time again that this \"goes against the natural growth\" of Wikipedia.  The idea of strict chronological importance, whereby only one composer is listed from a single period is very unpopular and overly strict.  If we were to be strict like this and ignore fame, then Western music would be dramatically reduced to only about 1/5 of the articles on this list generally, which would be fair but unrealistic.  The reality is that certain things are more famous and in demand than others.  The idea of leaving out Mozart is just silly and out of touch with Wikipedia and its users.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 17:38, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n::::Remember also that even if the English article is good, it's telling if there hasn't been much written in other languages or if the other articles are thinner than the English article.  This is the list of the most important Wikipedia articles, so we shouldn't usually have to choose between importance and popularity, I think.  --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 17:42, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n::::Concretely, I do think it would be a good idea to include possibly Beijing opera, Kabuki, Noh, Gamelan or Gregorian chant.  Each has little problems though: Beijing opera's article isn't very popular in non-English wikipedias; Kabuki and Noh are not strictly speaking forms of music, but rather drama;--[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 18:28, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:::::Yes, in the sense that Western opera is a form of drama.

Everything that you're saying is musically and historically correct, just not always appropriate.  We can't re-write Wikipedia from here, especially not in all its languages.\n::::As for the philosophy though, remember the purpose of the list: to aid smaller (non-English) wikipedias in getting a base of articles.  Myself, I tend to imagine one medium sized Wikipedia (Arabic) and one new, small Wikipedia ([[en:Egyptian Arabic]]).  For readers of both of these wikipedias, having an article about Mozart will be much more important than having an article about Noh or Gamelan.  The problem with these genres is that they are important in the eyes of western scholars, rather than average Westerners ''or'' average non-Westerners.  For example, even in Japan, J-Pop or [[en:Enka]] might be more popular and more accessed than [[en:Noh]].  Even for the average Chinese reader, the article on Mozart will be more useful than the article on Beijing opera.  So this is what I keep in mind. --[[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 18:28, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:::::That's essentially an appeal to the bottom-up method (as discussed above & below), which will undoubtedly become more feasible as time goes along. JWL, [[Special:Contributions/71.191.115.153|71.191.115.153]] 19:38, 25 April 2009 (UTC)\n:All I'm saying is that it's ''both'' popularity and importance (in terms of the God's eye view, as you're advocating); it can't be one or the other.  It can't be Celine Dion or Perotinus.  And I just want to warn against combating Eurocentrism by adding things that are famous non-Western concepts among ''Western scholars'' or other elites and not so much among actual non-Westerners.  For that reason, Umm Kulthum is extraordinarily important, but Beijing Opera perhaps less so.  Beijing Opera was important, but it doesn't attract much attention today, other than from scholars, and Western scholars perhaps more than Chinese.  I've had some quite awkward conversations with Chinese people asking about this sort of thing.  Umm Kulthum is still listened in every cafe in Egypt, and you will never have an awkward conversation about her (same goes for Vysotsky, etc.).  Everyone hears about Gamelan through, guess who, [[en:Pierre Boulez]].

Today Zhu Xi's influence is very limited.\n\n*[[en:Du Fu]] for [[en:Li Bai]]\nAlthough their achievements are very similar, much more Chinese poets learn from Du Fu(including Bai Juyi,Huang Tingjian and Lu You) than from Li Bai.And Du Fu was ranked #27 on Daniel S.

He is representative of the mediterranean middle ages.\nJorge Luis Borges is an important writter in the 20th century, but Wikipedia shouldn't give more importance to the recent literature than old literature.

What criteria was applied? This is what appears to have happened:\n\n* Population\n* Capitals were chosen over larger cities if that country already had a representing country.\n* Historically important cities\n* Social popularity\n\n'''Chosen:'''\n\n* [[en:Kinshasa|Kinshasa]] - capital of Democratic Republic of the Congo. 248,728 hits in 2008.\n* [[en:Lagos|Lagos]] - largest city in Nigeria. 441,671 hits in 2008.\n\n'''Not chosen:'''\n\n* No Canadian cities\n** [[en:Ottawa|Ottawa]] - capital of Canada. 690,528 hits in 2008.\n** [[en:Toronto|Toronto]] - largest city in Canada. 1,582,973 hits in 2008.\n* [[en:Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City]] - largest city and capital of Vietnam. 423,639 hits in 2008.\n\nThese were just a few I looked at. On a worldwide scope the chosen were more populous but I would say notably historically on an international level they lack significance over other cities. For example Ho Chi Minh City is a major economic center for Asia East and became politically important for Communism in China and the West during the Vietnam War and Cold War. Lagos and Kinshasa are really just big cities with much smaller world affect. Are populated cities really cities that every encyclopedia should have, or maybe things such as a cities importance to history and its global role be more closely prioritized. If not, then the same logic could be applied to other categories citing that because more people saw Wedding Crashers it should replace Citizen Kane (a film ranked for 50 years at the top of director and critic lists in film). [[Special:Contributions/207.6.241.10|207.6.241.10]] 03:11, 3 June 2009 (UTC)\n:I agree with removing these two. But I think it would be a better idea not to replace them with other cities, but to leave the space to expand other sections: History, Mathematics or even Biographies. I think that a full list of countries and specially, cities, is pretty much useless if they have no real worldwide influence, and even if they have, it seems much more useful an article about, for example, the [[:en:Cuban Missile Crisis]] or the [[:en:Cuban Revolution]] than a general article which speaks about the climate in [[:en:Cuba]]. We should not take the present configuration as unmodifiable, I think that the next step is precisely to rearrange the sections. --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 23:10, 10 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Proposed changes in Biography section==\n1. I propose merging several categories into Visual and Performing Artists and judging their merits against each other for contributing to the world as we know it. This would free up a lot of space very quickly.\n\n2. [[en:Helen Keller|Helen Keller]] made the list as a political leader, but [[en:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] did not? Are you kidding? He can also be included under Scientists.\n\n4. Propose to add [[en:Cleopatra|Cleopatra]] as a political leader. She was a very powerful leader in Ancient Egypt and her influence is felt throughout the world even today.\n\n5. Propose to keep Political Leaders and remove [[en:Aristocrat|Aristocrats]]. Aristocrats should have something to contribute politically to be included on this list or be moved. \n\n6. When choosing people to be on the list, I think it's important to ask, \"Did this person change the world?\" In that context, [[en:Sun Tsu|Sun Tsu]] is much more influential as a strategist and a mathematician than some celebrities of modern day. \n\n7. Under Religious Figures and Theologians, I propose to add [[en:Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] to the list, since a number of religions follow her to this day including Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Anglican Church, Islam, and certain Protestant denominations. [[User:USchick|USchick]] 02:35, 22 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n:Make sure to also include who you want to remove (in the same category) to make room for who you want to add. Also, some of your choices like Cleopatra were [[/Archives/2009#Replacement suggestions|talked about a few months ago]]. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 16:44, 23 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n::Propose merging the following categories into one under the title of Visual and Performing Artists: Actors, dancers and models, Artists and architects, Authors, playwrights and poets, Composers and musicians, Film directors and screenwriters. There are 83 people in this list combined, which makes it a very long list compared to other categories. Does the category of Visual and Performing Art deserve that much attention compared to other disciplines? It may, but it's something worth discussing.\n\n::: One person saying that Cleopatra \"didn't do anything\" is not exactly a discussion. When you mention the name Cleopatra, no one says, \"Which one?\" She was the head of state, in charge of the military and a royal dynasty. She continues to be included in history books of just about every language 2,000 years after her death. Any person who can not compete with that record can be replaced including: Sarah Bernhardt, Marlene Dietrich, George Byron, Vladimir Nabokov, Vladimir Vysotsky, Helen Keller, Saint Paul (not a founder of a religion, if anything, he can be replace by Mary), Augustine of Hippo (also not a founder of a religion. Why is this Saint different from any other Saint?)  [[User:USchick|USchick]] 01:12, 29 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Languages==\nSorry for coming in so late on this discussion. Under Specific languages how were the 18 languages selected and why 18? With the help of a linguist perhaps? If not, should one be consulted? For example, how did [[en:Tamil language|Tamil]], [[en:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]], and [[en:Bengali language|Bengali]] make the list? Is there something significant about these languages that make them worthy of inclusion over others? What about [[en:sign language|sign language]]?\n:18 is probably just happenstance. In general people seem to agree with the balance of topics so the category sizes have been constant. Of course a linguist would be useful but I think choices can also be made with common sense in the meantime. If a lot of people speak a language it is probably important to have in a Wikipedia.  Tamil has 66 million speaker compared with 27 million Dutch speakers, Sanskrit is sort the Indian latin, Bengali is the fifth most popular language in the world. Sign language is a type of language (not really a specific language like American Sign Language or British Sign Language?) and isn't nearly a popular as the current choices. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 06:43, 25 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Health and Medicine==\nThis is another category that can use a professional opinion. A medical professional would structure this category a little differently, such as: Infectious disease and Chronic disease and at the same time would make it much more accurate.\n\n==Professional Opinion==\nI propose that each category should be reviewed by professionals in that field for accuracy. For example, under the category of \"Raw Materials\" Wood is the only raw material. Paper (made from wood), plastic, and glass are not raw materials by definition because they have to be manufactured. Metal and stone on the other hand, are raw materials, but are not on the list. If this list is important, it needs to be accurate. [[User:USchick|USchick]] 02:42, 25 June 2009 (UTC)\n:I think the category should be changed to just \"Materials\". We do have [[en:Metal|Metal]] in the list under \"Physics\". And do already have [[en:Rock (geology)|Rock]] so \"Stone\" would be sort of redundant. -[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 06:51, 25 June 2009 (UTC)\n:: Since this category (Raw Materials) doesn't seem to serve any purpose, maybe it can be eliminated entirely. [[User:USchick|USchick]] 01:21, 29 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::I renamed the category to \"Materials\"; describes what's in well enough and it's useful to have some heading. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 18:06, 29 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Food For Thought==\nFor an English language Wikipedia to dictate to other Wikipedias what they \"should\" be doing is a very dangerous proposition and needs to be done very carefully, if at all. This idea is extremely Anglo-centric and rude. At the very least, the title of the page needs to be changed to something like \"Suggested topics for Wikipedias in all languages\" with an explanation of why this is important and how this list is limited in that it does not reflect local culture or history. It's not clear how much the current list represents a World View, and before it gets translated as a guide for other languages to follow, it needs to make sense in its original language, which currently it does not. Are there any editors here who are fluent in other languages? It would be very interesting to go to other translations of this page and to read their discussion pages to see what other people think of this concept. If anyone is able to do this, please report your findings. Is the rest of the world laughing at us for not knowing what Raw Materials are? Before we go around telling everyone else what they need to know, let's make sure we know what we're talking about, shall we? One more thing, at the top of this page, there needs to be a banner with a disclaimer saying that this page is under construction and that the information is disputed and controversial. [[User:USchick|USchick]] 05:51, 25 June 2009 (UTC)\n:The title may come off a little commanding but I think most people realize its just suggestions.  I think your rephrasing to remove the hint of rudeness IMO is little too PC. I have yet to hear a non-Anglo say they were offended. I have read a few discussion pages and the complaint I saw was people don't speak English well enough to even want to debate the inclusion or exclusion of entries. Or they think since it discussed in English it has to be biased.  Of course, people have to \"try to fix things\" otherwise it hopeless. BTW, there was a major redo of the list a few months ago to make the list less Anglo-centric. Check out the Archives. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 08:03, 25 June 2009 (UTC)\n::My suggestion to rename the page has to do with international diplomacy and cultural awareness and not political correctness. There are many multilingual administrators on Wikipedia who will be very happy to get involved if they are invited to participate and become aware of this project. The dangers of dictating what the rest of the world \"should\" be doing is evident in the global financial crisis that is currently underway and is a direct result of the rest of the world adopting \"the best financial system in the world that can not possibly fail\" (ours). We do not need to be writing instructions for the rest of the world to follow and doing it in English behind closed doors. If this is a worthwhile project, I encourage it to be more collaborative and at minimum be based on generally accepted facts.

Myself and mine included. By what other standards you would know what \"generally accepted facts\" are is also beyond me. \n:::So, if you have suggestions to improve the coverage of world-wide topics, please propose changes. If I understand correctly, you propose to add [[:en:Raw material]] to the list.

I respect the fact that a lot of time has been invested in this page. You are correct when you say that I do not understand the difference between English Wikipedia and a Meta-Wiki. Is this explained somewhere? At the same time, I question the categories that have been selected and the lists that follow because they do not reflect generally accepted facts and principles of existing classification systems (in any language). Were they based on something? For example: under the existing category Raw Materials, the items listed are not raw materials. Under the category Health and Medicine, the list that follows does not reflect how classifications are made in the medical field. Under Weather, climate and geology, Geology is a science, which is not related in any way to weather and climate. Why is Architecture and civil engineering listed under Arts and recreation? Why are Foodstuffs and Beverages listed under Science? What classification system is being used here?  [[User:USchick|USchick]] 18:54, 25 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::::Meta, as the intro says, is dedicated to coordination and documentation of Wikimedia's projects (the other reason why it's in English, as Wikimedia Foundation is an initiative started by Americans). English Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, as you probably know well, and one of many Wikimedia's projects that Meta covers.\n:::::I understand now what you feel is wrong with this list. To be honest, it probably doesn't follow any formal classification scheme, because many people add and delete entries, and reorganize how they feel is right. I very much agree that the current scheme has many problems but I'm afraid nobody here knows enough about these things to propose a useful general classification. There were some attempts (see for example the top of this talk page), but nothing came out of them. Feel free to change listing order within categories if you have an idea how it should be done, but for larger changes, we'd appreciate if you opened a discussion here first.

But perhaps we could remove [[en:Baseball]] which was recently removed from the Olympics because its not popular in all countries.  And for the suggestion of including Citrus instead of Grape and Lemon. I don't believe [[en:Grape]] is a [[en:Citrus]] so it just doesn't sound reasonable. My two cents. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 05:21, 6 July 2009 (UTC)\n::::Sure, obviously had confused \"Grapefruit\" with \"Grape\", which are important for the production of wine. Perhaps \"Baseball\" could be removed, but perhaps the list should not depend too much on the arbitrary and most recent decisions of sports officials. It is a bit confusing to discuss unrelated topics such as forms of sexuality, fruit and sports the same time. \n::::For an estimation of the status of the entries of the list's current \"social issues\" section, one could look at the [http://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html table of contents] of the Standord Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, which has about 2,000 entries. Among them are: abortion, punishment and legal punishment, race, human rights. But there is also an article on homosexuality. Of course this should not be the only source for this wikimedia list.

It sounds to me like an umbrella term for different sports with different popularity. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 13:15, 4 August 2009 (UTC)\n:::::::I know it seems weird, but on the English wiki, [[en:Rugby|Rugby]] is a disambigulation page, and [[en:rugby football]] deals with the various forms of rugby, including [[en:rugby union|rugby union]] and [[en:rugby league|rugby league]].  On the Spanish and French wikis, rugby links to a description of the sport, and there is no such article as rugby football.  The term \"rugby football\" comes as a quirk of using English (a language fought over between the Americans and the Brits) as the default language of this list. [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 15:29, 4 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Unclear entries ==\n\nBased on the iw-links some of the entries on this list seem to be a bit unclear:\n# [[:en:sex]] has links to articles in Scandinavian languages like [[:sv:K\u00f6n]], [[:no:Kj\u00f8nn]], [[:da:K\u00f8n]] etc. which mean biological sex or gender. On the other hand the same article links to German [[:de:Sex]] which is rather the sexual practice. It seems to me that in languages of latin origin (incl English in this case) these two concepts are described with the same word and so are naturally described in one article. I think it would be a good idea to clear out more precisely which concept is meant to be included in this list, and then try to sort out iw-links. I find it difficult to sort things out myself as English is not my mother tongue, so I can't really tell the exact differences of all the concepts like [[:en:Sex]], [[:en:Sexual intercourse]], [[:en:Biological sex]], [[:en:Sexual reproduction]] etc.\n# [[:en:Law]] had a similar confusion regarding iw-links, as some languages seem to understand rather the field of science, other a particular rule. It seems that this might have been cleared up and etymological related Scandinavian words like [[:sv:Lag]], [[:da:Lov (jura)]], [[:nn:Lov]] are now linked with German [[:de:Gesetz]], [[:la:Lex]] (incl its derivations in modern romance languages) and many other languages not including English. There is anyway a tendency that people add [[:en:Law]] to this circle of articles, introducing an iw-conflict. Maybe this is a concept that should exist also in the English wp?\n\nThese are just two examples, but I think there are also other unclear concepts on this list. Would it be possible for someone running an iw-bot to check all the articles on this list, and whereever there is an iw-conflict, we try to fix it, either by removing obvisiouly misplaced iw-links or by clearing out more precisely which concept is meant to be on the list? [[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] 08:56, 22 July 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Five Americans to add, in Purplebackpack89's opinion ==\n\nHonestly, there have been numerous discussions about how Eurocentric this list is.  And they're right.  No offense, but it seems that any podunk European artist or intellectual can make the list (another note...HEAVY HEAVY bias towards intellectuals), whereas all but the greatest Americans ([[en:George Washington|Washington]], [[en:Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]], [[en:Thomas Edison|Edison]], [[en:Martin Luther King, Jr.|MLK Jr.]]) make the cut.  And to my nominations \n\nIn the politicians category:\n\n*[[en:Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]]\n:Reasoning--it's basically like this...if DeGaulle's in, Eisenhower should be too.  He cleaned up [[en:World War II|the mess that men like DeGaulle couldn't]], then served as President of a nation more powerful and populous than France.\n*[[en:Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]]\n:I don't quite see the logic in picking Washington and FDR as America's two best political leaders, even though they did more on the world stage.  Lincoln is viewed as a symbol of American freedom in many distant lands.  Plus, most historical rankings of American figures put Abe above GW\n*[[en:Barack Obama|Obama]]\n:Reverse logic here.  Just add him to the list because he already has a Wikipedia article in over 150 languages, dozens more than Washington\n\nIn one of the intellectual categories\n*[[en:Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]]\n*[[en:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] '''in bold'''.\n:The philosophers and intellectuals lists are heavy on dead Europeans, while being light on dead Americans.  I know both of these men were politicians too, but they were also two of the main founders of American political thought, as witnessed by the volumes Thomas Jefferson wrote on anything and everything  \n\nCUT TO OFFSET:\n*[[en:Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]].  \n:Make no mistake about it.  I think Noam's a great thinker.  But I don't think that he's worthy of being one of the 20-30 greatest social scientists in the history of the world, nor do I think he's one of the couple hundred people most worthy of a Wikipedia article in 100+ languages \n*[[en:Steven Speilberg|Speilberg]]\n:You could get me to agree with you that Steven is one of the greatest movie directors in America.

Let me just list some arguments against.\n:1. adding 5 political figures, and removing none. Without explanation why political figures are more important than other people.\n:2. adding 5 Americans when a lot of people come to this discussion complaining it is too Western.\n:3. adding Obama merely because he is popular when the list is about importance (popular != importance)\n:4. removing Speilberg when he's the last big movie director remaining (just removed George Lucus)\n:--[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 22:55, 24 July 2009 (UTC)\n\n::Since you chose to poke holes, I'll poke holes in your holes by restating some of my points above, and adding new ones.  For starters, I nominated Franklin and Jefferson as philosophers, which they were, rather than political figures.  America is NOT well represented by philosophers, except for Noam Chomskey (yes, he's American).  I feel that there are not enough world leaders on the list, and, as a political determinist, I feel that political events impact history (which biography basically is), and I feel that Abraham Lincoln had a bigger impact on both American and world history than most of the Americans on the list (with the exception of [[en:George Washington|GW]] and [[en:Thomas Edison|Edison]]) and many of the political leaders on the list.  Would you argue that Spielberg is more important, in or out of America, than Lincoln (especially considering that historians have yet to weigh in on Speilberg, and Hitch and Disney are still on the list)?  And add [[en:Helen Keller|Helen Keller]] to the boot list, at least out of the political section, to make space for Lincoln.  I admit that the cases for Obama and Eisenhower are weak, but you've at least gotta admit that Lincoln, Jefferson, and Franklin deserve inclusion.  Oh, and one more thing...I have not proposed cutting ANY non-Westerners, just replacing some (worse) Westerners with some better ones.

[[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 20:01, 28 July 2009 (UTC)\n\n:Comment: I would avoid adding one type of article and removing another. Such as adding a biography and removing a language. There are two reasons (1) it is hard to compare the importance of two completely different topics (2) it will distort the proportion of articles in each topic and we will eventually have 1000 biographies. So if we are adding \"Lincoln\" which historical figure should be removed?\n\n:That said, I tend to lean toward adding articles about events or machines than people. For example \"American Civil War\" instead of \"Abraham Lincoln\". \"Aircraft\" instead of \"Wright Bros\". Also when figuring out importance, you have think historical importance, too. \"Damascus\", the city, has been around since 10000 BC. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 20:52, 28 July 2009 (UTC)\n\n: Just for you to know, Damascus is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world.

And to Santista, I somewhat agree that it's counterproductive to try and change the whole system, and instead we should focus on little improvement (i.e. getting Lincoln or Jefferson or Rugby or Columbia on the list).  That being said, I do think that there is a bias on this list to [[en:computer science|computer science]] and related fields.  [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 02:30, 29 July 2009 (UTC)\n\n::By the way, if you want to toss [[en:Baseball|baseball]] (and personally, I don't), here's what you should add: [[en:Boxing|Boxing]] or [[en:Wrestling|Wrestling]].

If there aren't any important enough composer or musician from the rest of the world, then probably this section is over sized, and most of the entries can be removed and the places in the list be used for something else.

So I suggest switching them, removing speed from the list and including velocity.--[[User:Gom\u00e0|Gom\u00e0]] 07:19, 11 August 2009 (UTC)\n:I can see your point, except that Wikipedia tends to be written more for Joe Avgs. than physicists [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 13:50, 12 August 2009 (UTC)\n::Perhaps in English the word speed is more common than velocity but the article is writen in a clear phisics point of view focusing on the modulus of the velocity. In other languages the most common word is the corresponding to velocity (romanic languages) with the same meaning, the translaton of speed is a word similar to ''celerity'' that is a very technical word only used in phisics. Furthermore, the article is classified into Science/ Phisics. Then the article deserving to belong to the list of 1000 articles every wikipedia should have is velocity rather than speed. --[[User:Gom\u00e0|Gom\u00e0]] 18:53, 12 August 2009 (UTC)\n:::Agree with Gom\u00e0. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 06:35, 13 August 2009 (UTC)\n:I agree, velocity is more important. Take a look at the English Wikipedia articles for each - speed has a very short article with very little important information other than the definition, velocity has a much longer article.

The concept of velocity is a compound, of which I think only the speed element is key, and it is a compound that most languages do not have, so stating that all wikipediae should have an article about it is pointless: they can't. [[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] 18:22, 21 August 2009 (UTC)\n:::::Thinking of the velocity as a compound because of its Cartesian (or any other coordinate system) components is like thinking of a point as a compound because of its Cartesian components. Velocity is a singular concept, even if it is a vector. Speed is a concept derived from velocity that cannot be explained without the aid of velocity. Wikipedia is about concepts, not words.

A 'point in space' may have them ''attached'', although many other types of coordinates could also serve.

A 'vector' may have them ''attached'', although many other types of coordinates could also serve. Speed in physics is derived from velocity and is explained as the modulus of velocity; in fact, the change in spatial position makes no sense without the directional component of velocity and speed only can be explained without the aid of the concept of velocity by reducing space dimensions to 1 (linear movement) and hiding its vector nature.\n::::::: Instead of discussing about the fundamentals of the physical concepts I suggest you reading the articles as they are now. As they are, the situation is this: ''Speed'' article don't say anything else than: ''Speed is the modulus of velocity''. If you can improve the article speed with external references in the way you point to then perhaps I could agree.

It has between 115,000 and 2 million speakers total (let's say 1.5 million for argument's sake), not even a tenth part of either German or Portuguese.  Also, on the English wikipedia, Esperanto had less hits than Portuguese, and considerably less hits than German.  Mars, Japf, Santista, maybe toss Esperanto for Portuguese?  Toss something else besides Esperanto or German?  What do you think? [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 19:57, 20 October 2009 (UTC)\n\n::::I agree with Andejons that there should be more than one criteria so I am not sure it as clear cut as tossing the fewest speakers for one of the most. We should with the short list try to touch as many topics as possible. Esperanto is there to touch on [[w:Constructed language|constructed langauges]].  There are so many European languages already that if editors completed the list I am sure with 99% certainty they would have covered Portuguese. But the same cannot be said for Esperanto or some of the foreign languages like Tamil. Anyway I wouldn't disagree with the suggested change, or replacing Turkish, or just leaving it the same. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 21:49, 20 October 2009 (UTC)\n:::: I think the list is not to mention all the largest things, but a hint to write the first interesting content of a new Wikipedia edition. If so, Esperanto is good on the list, since one can write in the article something less banal than number of speakers and countries where it's official. \n:::: If it depended on my will, I would cut down from the 1000 list as much \u201etemplate articles\u201c as I could. Adding (often with a bot, or even by hand but without much thinking)  articles with a large template full of numbers is the weird way how many smaller editions now start.

[[User:Amikeco|Amikeco]] 06:01, 7 November 2009 (UTC)\n::::: In my opinion, Esperanto undoubtedly should stay in the list as as the most important representant of constructed languages, in the same way as Latin is there as a representant of important historic languages (although it is spoken by a small number of people today). --[[User:Petrus Adamus|Petrus Adamus]] 17:11, 8 November 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Replacing Pig ==\n\nI think that the [[:en:Pig]] entry should be replaced. This genus doesn't have much characteristics to distinguish it from the family [[:en:Suidae]], so if somebody will try to expand it in order to get it over 30.000 characters, it will invariably mean duplicating content from the Suidae article and probably also from [[:en:Domestic pig]] as the english article does now. That's why I suggest replacing the [[:en:Pig]] entry with either [[:en:Suidae]] (as a more relevant grouping), [[en:Domestic pig]] (as the one pig species important enough to be here), or some other animal group alltogether (because we already have a lot of domestic animals in the list). Comments/suggestions? --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 08:48, 17 September 2009 (UTC)\n:the Suidae article is even smaller than the Pig article so that wouldn't be a good change. I think \"Domestic Pig\"  makes sense since the animal is important for being domesticated. And it's match \"Domestic Sheep\" which is also in the list. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 17:48, 17 September 2009 (UTC)\n::Like I said, [[:en:Pig]] is larger because it contains information that belongs to either [[:en:Suidae]] or [[:en:Domestic pig]] article. Suidae, on the other hand, has a lot of potential for growth because it's a very distinct and well researched group of mammals. [[:en:Domestic pig]] is an option as well, if you feel that the abundance of domestic animals on the list is not a problem. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 07:51, 18 September 2009 (UTC)\n:::Ok, since nobody objected to this change I went ahead and changed it to \"Domestic pig\". --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 06:32, 29 September 2009 (UTC)\n::::It looked like Yerpo just objected...  additionally, you forgot to add it to the list of removed articles above.

I agree we do have a lot of domestic animals but IMHO they are more important because of farming, breeding, foodstuff, etc.  If we have a domestic animal limit, we should poll which are the most important domestic animals (pick seven?) 1) cattle 2) horse 3) domestic sheep 4) domestic pig 5) chicken 6) cat 7) dog 8) camel. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 19:01, 29 September 2009 (UTC)\n\n::::::I didn't explicitly object, I just said that Suidae would be (IMO) a more suitable replacement.

Their basic goal is indeed to be a ''general'' reference suitable for ''general'' audience - meaning average readers (even if articles may also contain specialized information or be about specialized topics). This applies even more to the list of 1000 '''basic''' topics we are creating here. Specialized projects, such as [[:Wikispecies]], are separate from Wikipedia. As for your other argument, this list is by no means exclusive to meta users. I, for example, am primarily a (Slovene) Wikipedia editor, and speak from that experience when suggesting or commenting changes to the list. So does probably everybody else. Most Wikipedias have a translated local version of the list (see links at the top of the page), with the link back here.

Judo is essentially a type of wrestling; both sports involve grounding the opponent with various manuveurs.  Judo is practiced mostly in Japan and is only a hundred years old, wrestling in its various forms has been practiced for millenia and is done all over the world.  So replace judo (the specific) with wrestling (the general) [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]]\n:Judo is not a type of wrestling, and is practiced in many countries.

[[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] 17:41, 11 October 2009 (UTC)\n::::::::I don't consider this a role-playing game either, I consider this a place to express views about ideas. Which I did. If you choose to take it personally, that's your liberty. I can only assure other people reading this that it wasn't meant personally. I meant to say that \"wrestling\" (as well as kickboxing, now that you mention it) has a meaning specific to human activity in the most common sense of the word (reflected in the [[:en:Wrestling|english article]] about it). More precisely, they refer to human activities with rules that are based on reason, not instinct. If you want evidence, do a Google search on \"animal wrestling\" and see what kind of hits you get. There's also the [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wrestling Merriam-Webster definition], which again fails to mention animal wrestling. You can also check Wikipedia articles in other languages, and you'll see that elsewhere animals aren't mentioned either (at least articles in languages I have a basic grasp of). --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 07:15, 12 October 2009 (UTC)\n\n<--OK, let me clarify.  When I said \"wrestling\", I was referring to the '''human''' sport that has origins in ancient countries, has been played at the Ancient and Modern Olympic Games, and has variations all over the world, such as sumo wrestling.  To add it, I propose removing judo, which is only 200 years old and is not widely practiced outside of Asia, and (on the most basic level) is a type of wrestling, since both involving getting your opponent to stay on the ground.  The amount of knowledge used to wrestle is a side point; the main question, posed to both Guido and Yerpo, is, \"is wrestling more important on the world stage and therefore more deserving of a 1000 article than Judo?\" [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 06:00, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n\n:<s>I support replacing \"judo\" with \"wrestling\" for the reasons given.</s> --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 06:56, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n::I disagree. The question is not the importance on the world stage, but the knowledge that an article woud provide. By the way, judo is practiced at top level outside Asia, too.

[[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] 10:15, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::I made the same mistake than you when I first heard of the term \"wrestling\", thinking about that American performance show that masquerades as sport - [[:en:Professional wrestling|professional wrestling]]. Please, read the relevant articles. \"Wrestling\" is the broadest term, comparable in scope to \"martial arts\", which is in the list, and broader than \"judo\" which falls under martial arts. Therefore, it conveys broader (more \"key\" as you would put it) knowledge. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 11:33, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n::::Sigh. No, I did not make that mistake. [[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] 11:46, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n:::::Hmm, now that I think about it, it seems that it's me who made a mistake about what belongs where. Sorry about that. In that case, I think neither should be in the list, because if we include any of those, we raise an issue of all the other martial arts techniques - kung fu, karate, kendo, boxing, fencing, jujutsu, etc., etc. Who will decide which one's more important than the rest? --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 11:59, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n::::::That is a good point, thanks for reconsidering. We currently have Karate and Judo listed. If we are to drop both, we have room for something else. That could, for instance, be [[en:Bow (weapon)|Bow]] and [[en:Kata|Kata]]. Or something entirely different, of course. Any thoughts? [[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] 12:44, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n:::::::One way of doing it would be to put one \"eastern\" and one \"western\" martial-arts technique in the list, and try to figure out which two would be the most appropriate (in terms of popularity, knowledge, historical importance, etc.).

Anybody else? --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 13:03, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n<--I agree, with the stipulation that they be general terms for sports that can, and are, played anywhere.  Probably wrestling or boxing for the west and karate or taekwando for the east.  Just my thoughts.  It's worth noting that of those four, wrestling and boxing are ancient and modern Olympic standbys, taekwando has been in the Olympics for a few years now, Judo's been in since '64, and karate isn't in [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] 17:40, 14 October 2009 (UTC)\n:I don't see how entering two martial arts examples is 'one way of doing it', 'it' being listing no examples.

[[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] 12:00, 15 October 2009 (UTC)\n\n::With \"it\" I meant \"something else\", more precisely, avoiding western bias that this list has been criticized for. At least in common usage, there's a widespread distinction between martial-arts techniques that originated in the far east, and those from the western world.

Not a single article that says anything significant about nordic history, culture or geography (Except the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, none of which seems to be really all that important from a non-Eurocentric point of view). Also the baltic states seem to be forgotten. Are the nordic countries really so much less important than the rest of Europe?\n\n*Finland has played a great part in keeping <s>Russia</s> the Soviet Union away from the rest of Europe throughout the 20th century, without this being mentioned much in the history books (or on wikipedia).\n*Finland has a remarkable geography, with all its lakes.\n*The vikings were influential in most of Europe for a few hundred years[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Viking_Expansion.svg]. Not any less historically important than the article about the Hundred Years' War, the American Civil War, the reformation, the Great Depression, the German nazis or Holocaust (there is already one on WWII). Norse language also had a great influence on the English language.\n*Norway has a remarkable coastline with all its fjords, none of which are mentioned on this list. The long \"bodies of water\"-section needs at least two or three fjords.\n*Norway is today an economically and politically powerful state, despite being one of the smallest nations in Europe. It is also ranked by the UN to be the worlds best country to live in. Scandinavian citizens are considered to have a higher standard of living than most of the world, including Northern America and the rest of Europe.\n*Norse mythology is as rich as any other kind of religion, and is, together with details from the norse language, even today used and explored by various people, for example musicians and writers.\n\nIn the \"countries\" sections, there are listed several European countries similar to the nordic countries in size and importance: Greece, Austria, Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, New Zealand... But none of the nordic or baltic countries. It seems to be a random collection of countries.\n\nA couple of proposals:\n*Remove Ireland, Austria, Netherlands and Switzerland. They share most of their history with other european countries that are already listed, and are therefore even less important articles than the nordic countries. Put Finland and some of the Scandinavian and /or baltic states into the countries section.\n*Remove some of the less remarkable /important bodies of water, like the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, Niger River, North Sea, Danube (only important in an all-European world), Rhine (not even top 100 of worlds longest rivers!). Put in the worlds two biggest fjords. (The [[:en:Scoresby Sund|Scoresby Sund]] and the [[:en:Sognefjord|Sognefjord]]).\n*Put in Greenland, the world's biggest island.\n*Remove Nazi Germany to get room for the vikings.

I mean, a large part of the article is about how the term is used, who has called Ethiopia or Lybia part of Middle East and how right he has been, etc. Since Wikipedia is not a vocabulary, I propose to change the (very English-centered btw) article [[:en:Middle East]] by something more clearly existing (there are many proposals, I suppose). [[User:Amikeco|Amikeco]] 06:01, 7 November 2009 (UTC)\n:All wikipedias will get lexicographic somewhere, especially considering most languages are living languages with  distinctions in meaning that change from century to century and region to region; that does not mean they are inappropriate for the list.

This seems very clear to me, not only because the general use of the first one, but also because of the sublist that depends on this article. I think that the person who proposed initially this article was thinking in \"State of matter\". --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 22:55, 6 December 2009 (UTC)\n:I think \"State of matter\" is slightly more specific topic which I think makes it a more useful article to have than \"Phase\". --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 19:42, 8 December 2009 (UTC)\n::Shall we change it then? --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 18:57, 11 December 2009 (UTC)\n::I am not familiar with the routines for chaning the list.

IMO having the actual religion in the list is enough. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 19:33, 8 December 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Remove snow and rain, add precipitation (and wind) ==\n\nMy opinion is that the subjects of \"[[en:Rain|rain]]\" and \"[[en:Snow|snow]]\" are overlapping to much. To discuss how snow and rain are formed, much of the same has to be repeated since rain are often formed as snow melts on the way down from the clouds. All of this would fit better by discussing \"precipitation\" in general. Precipitation is also what is interesting in the water cycle. Snow has another problem, since it can refer to snowfall, snow cover or snow as material. Yet another precipitation related article is \"acid rain\". I suggest that precipitation should replace rain and snow as articles every Wikipedia should have. Doing this would make it possible to add \"[[en:Wind|wind]]\", which is a very basic meteorological subject. --[[User:Kr-val|Kr-val]] 12:27, 15 December 2009 (UTC)\n:Sounds reasonable. Btw, Precipitation at enwiki is a disambig. I suppose the relevant article is [[:en:Precipitation (meteorology)]]. --[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] 07:18, 16 December 2009 (UTC)\n::I agree. and it allows us to add wind which I was surprised was missing. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 17:29, 16 December 2009 (UTC)\n:::Ok, I made the change since nobody objected. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 02:13, 18 December 2009 (UTC)\n:Don't you think the relevant article would be [[:en:Rain]]?

Couldn't we keep Rain and Wind? --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 16:11, 18 December 2009 (UTC)\n::\"Rain\" is a much more common term than \"Precipitation\" but when you compare the two en.wp articles the latter seems more useful. On the other hand having \"Acid rain\" and not having \"Rain\" seems a little odd. If one more person can give their opinion it would be useful. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 17:15, 18 December 2009 (UTC)\n::: precipitation is more generic, but that's a list of fundamental articles and rain is more common. --[[User:Mafoso|Mafoso]] 20:37, 18 December 2009 (UTC)\n:::: To me precipitation seems like a more encyklopedic subject than rain.

In some languages the consept of deity is just going to be called god anyway, because not all languages have one Germanic and one Latinate word for basically the same thing. Here's how the repsective English articles start defining god and diety:\n* [[:en:God]]: \"God most commonly refers to the deity worshiped by followers of monotheistic and monolatrist religions, whom they believe to be the creator and overseer of the universe.\" \u2013 but of course the word can also be used of the dieties of polytheistic religions (e.g. the gods of Greek and Roman mythology).\n* [[:en:Deity]]: \"A deity is a postulated preternatural or supernatural being, who is always of significant power, worshipped, thought holy, divine, or sacred, held in high regard, or respected by human beings.\" \u2013 The article then goes on to describe the concept of God.\nI suggest dropping [[:en:Deity]] --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.2.62|140.180.2.62]] 19:56, 4 March 2008 (UTC)\n:Actually Deity is bold (as in being more important of the two) but it would be a hard sell removing \"God\". -[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 01:30, 8 March 2008 (UTC)\n::Well, but then the question arises: should it be bold? Maybe god should be bold and deity removed? There's no need to have two articles that basically discuss the same thing on the list. In fact there's no need to have two articles in the English Wikipedia at all, one ought to be a redirect to the other. But in any case you are a deity [[:en:iff|iff]] you are a god. And therefore not all languages will have words to distinguish artificially between the two so as to be able to write two articles. Think of it this way: What if the list were in German and users agreed that it was important to have to have three major cognitive abilities [[:de:wissen|wissen]], [[:de:Wiktionary:kennen|kennen]], and [[:de:k\u00f6nnen|k\u00f6nnen]]. Well, English wouldn't be able to have all the articles on the list because there's only one word for all the German words, viz. \"to know\". Now in this case it's worse, because unlike knowing that, knowing how and simply knowing where there's actually a distinction to be made, there's no real distinction to be made between a deity and a god \u2014 if x is a god, then x is a deity; and if x is a deity, then x is a god. The English Wikipedia shouldn't even have two articles just because it has two words, let alone require all other languages to coin words so as to be able to make the same artificial distinction. So having both words on the list makes it linguistically biased. --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.20.42|140.180.20.42]] 03:56, 8 March 2008 (UTC)\n:::There is a difference between 'God' and 'god'. I think you are correct 'god' == 'deity' but 'God' is more specific than 'deity' since it is the specific deity for Christianity, Judaism and even Islam (since I believe 'God' == 'Allah'). But I get your point of heavy overlap between the two topics. Its similar to the overlap between [[en:Respiratory system]] and [[en:Lung]]. Also, one of the complaints about this list is its too \"Western oriented\" so my gut feeling is we need both of them. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 18:04, 8 March 2008 (UTC)\n::::But this article is not confined to the [[:en:God in Abrahamic religions]].

I still think that the English articles God and Deity should simply be merged. If you disagree with that, then presumably you are of the opinion that God ought to be merged with [[:en:God in Abrahamic religions]]. Or am I mistaken? --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.20.42|140.180.20.42]] 19:21, 8 March 2008 (UTC)\n:::::Didn't realise the [[en:God]] article was made so generic. There is still a difference between the two topics where 'God' is a subset of 'deity'. ('God' is the singular deity for monotheistic religion where as 'deity' includes plural god religions). My guess is when other people create their initial 'God' article it will match the more specific 'God in Christianity and Judaism' sense (not the over analyzed 'God in the generic sense'). So, you're right there is a lot of overlap if you assume other wikis are going to copy en.wp way of organizationing itself. But I hope they don't. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 20:45, 8 March 2008 (UTC)\n::::::But they have to if they want to complete the list. That's what I am saying. Because there IS no distinction between god and deity, although it CAN BE MADE artificially since English has two words. But in some other languages the article for god is going to contain both the discussion for god and deity because not all languages have two words for the same thing, one of a Germanic root and the other derived from Latin. And those languages will therefore always miss one of the two articles. Unless they have an article about god in Abrahamic religions and then another about god/deity (which would then be really be about god/deity in general). But the iw-links will then only link to one of the two articles on the list anyway (because the former would link to [[:en:God in Abrahamic religions]] and the latter to either one of the other two, [[:en:God]] or [[:en:Deity]]). Besides the idea that the word god refers to a monotheistic conception of a deity is simply incorrect. Zeus is a god (in fact his very name is a cognate of the word deity, both deriving from the same Indo-European root). Apollo is also a god. So is Neptune and Odin. The gods of polytheistic religions are also called gods. It is only a spelling convention in Christian countries which dictates that when referring to the Christian god ([[:en:Sic|sic]]) the word should be spelled with a capital letter. --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.20.42|140.180.20.42]] 21:19, 8 March 2008 (UTC)\n::::::[[:en:Divinity]] is another article that ought to be merged with [[:en:God]] and [[:en:Deity]]. --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.20.42|140.180.20.42]] 06:51, 9 March 2008 (UTC)\n:::::::Thankfully that one isn't in this list.

But I am looked forward to someone else commenting. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 18:14, 9 March 2008 (UTC)\nTo Christians, and I expect followers of some other religions, there is a big difference between God, '''the''' God, and any old deity.

But the article about the Christian god is called [[:en:God in Abrahamic religions]]. God in Abrahamic religions is certainly different from god/deity in general. The question is which article all Wikipedias ought to have. I'm arguing that an article about deity makes an article about god (as opposed to God in Abrahamic religions) redundant and vice versa. But the argument for having both (and it doesn't seem a good one to me) is that the difference is that the article about deity is about any deity, whereas the article about god is about any monotheistic deity and finally God in Abrahamic religions is about that specific deity. This doesn't seem to hold water. --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.20.42|140.180.20.42]] 11:27, 10 March 2008 (UTC)\n::I agree dropping deity. --[[Special:Contributions/62.57.188.242|62.57.188.242]] 15:21, 13 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Speed and Velocity ==\n\nSpeed and Velocity are close related.

The usual way to put this list to use in a small wp is to translate it locally and then start creating articles for the hundreds of red links that result from the translation. There is no particular logic as to why this list should be 1000 articles long, rather than, say 500 or 1500 articles, other than sheer practicality. If it is too long, a small wp project (with say four very active contributors) will feel discouraged by the work involved in translating it.

The same list in English Wikipedia only have 120. Therefore, I suggest reducing the number of biography articles to (at most) <200 or have a further cut to <150. -- [[Special:Contributions/202.40.137.196|202.40.137.196]] 09:44, 24 March 2008 (UTC)\n: Originally the intention was to have 100, but this quickly grew and when I first started reducing the list a realistic objective seemed to get them down to 200. I agree that they are too many, but this is the section which has the most tendency to grow by \"spurious edits\" - i.e. anonymous edits that just add one or two entries one time and don't do anything else. Above, I suggested moving the entire section to the back of the list (and possibly, the geography section as well), which IMHO would somewhat discourage these additions. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 14:29, 24 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:: I also was quite irratated that there are so many people on the list, many of whom I never heard of. Wikipedia is about bringing knowledge to the world, and I think that one could include worthier articles on history, politics, science or even religion. I suggest the following:\n\n::- Cut down the list of biographys.\n::- Replace some architects/poets/dancers/etc. with historical or political figures. Explorers are fine too. People are affected by history every day, not so much by all of the dancers/singers/poets etc.\n::- Expand the other sections.\n\n::Seriously, not everyone on the globe needs to know Shakespeare (I have read some of his works and they're great, don't get me wrong here), but I think people will gain more from Wikipedia if they can inform themselves on real-life topics. After all, Wikipedia can help to inform correctly, nullifying prejudices and even stopping hate and war. \n::One example: the Middle East conflict.

However, I think your weighting for Mathematics is a bit high. I would prefer to take away some articles from Mat and give them back to science. If we left Science as is, that would still be +18 for Math, right? -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 17:37, 25 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n::Changed according to your suggestions (Science: 225 -> 244; Maths: 70 -> 51). Welcome everyone to give more comments. -- [[User:Kevinhksouth|Kevinhksouth]] 04:13, 26 March 2008 (UTC)\n\nMaking major swings at this point would be tough, so I would ask that we take the positive scores from Math, Tech, Culture, Society, and History, and give it to the other categories (somewhat evenly proportioned). Why? For one, it's terribly difficult to add or subtract because every choice at this point would take a decision by committee. (The committee = us!) The fewer decisions we need to make, the sooner we can get this to 1000. After we get to the magic number 1000, we can do trades (\"X is more important than Y\") until we get something that we're satisfied with. Maybe your proposed equilibrium could be an additional step in the future to work towards.\n\nThat being said, I could see us trimming down some of the grains which seem to be over-emphasized: (I say, keep Maize and Rice in Ceareals, and ditch the rest of the cereals.) Therefore, I propose we make Foodstuffs -5 instead of -7.\n\nI would prefer to lower the number trimmed out of biography from -100 to -35. It's painful enough removing stuff; I can't imagine picking 100 to remove! I'd rather keep History, Math, and Tech closer to where they are right now, rather than make such big and painful swings to the Biographical group.\n\nJust my 2 cents. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 17:13, 26 March 2008 (UTC)\n: I think we could keep the Technology articles at 75 and that allows us to remove 35 fewer biographies. --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.3.65|140.180.3.65]] 23:27, 26 March 2008 (UTC)\n\nOkay. I have updated the table. I plan to split this project into 2 phases. The first phase it to bring back the number of articles back to 1000, by just removing articles from Biography & Geography sections. After we get back to 1000, we can improve the proportion of articles in the next phase. Would it be more practical? -- [[User:Kevinhksouth|Kevinhksouth]] 08:53, 27 March 2008 (UTC)\n\nGood, but let's make it Biography -40, Geography -18, Foodstuffs -5.

[[User:Yann|Yann]]\n\n==Importance of living people==\n[[:en:WP:ITN/C]] is a forum for proposing and developing a consensus on which news items should be included on the [[:en:WP:ITN|ITN]] template. Because of repeated disputes about objectively assessing the importance of a recently deceased person (specifically the non-inclusion of [[:en:Edmund Hillary]], [[:en:Pavarotti]], [[:en:Arthur C. Clarke]], [[:en:Bobby Fischer]]) in light of the limits imposed by [[:en:WP:ITNMP|existing criteria]], we are attempting to compile a reasonably authoritative [[:en:Template:In the news/Important living people|list of important living people]] in connection with revising the criteria. The proposal is that if someone on the list died, that would warrant an automatic nomination at the very least. The list does not have a hard ceiling on size, but it is anticipated that, unlike [[:en:Deaths in 2008|recent deaths]], there would be no more than on the order of 1 name per week (yes, it's morbid); thus importance might be calibrated to the 50 most important people who [[:en:Deaths in 2007|died in 2007]].

[[:en:Venezuela]] is probably a better choice of a high priority country, though its influence is mostly a modern phenomenon.  [[:en:Portugal]] is probably also not necessary as high priority.  It was a colonial power, but so was Holland, which doesn't even make the list, and modern Portuguese influence isn't significant overall.\n\nI'd also suggest removing the [[:en:Vatican City]] from the list.  Having someone write an article about the Vatican instead of about [[:en:Catholicism]] would be silly.\n\n[[:en:Zimbabwe]] and [[:en:Somalia]] might be worth adding.

People may be concentrating too much on the new and glamorous aspects of physics and neglecting the fundamentals.--[[User:Cato|Cato]] 11:58, 27 May 2008 (UTC)\nShould we just change Quantum Mechanics to Mechanics, or should we introduce Mechanics with subdivisions Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics?  --[[User:Redaktor|Redaktor]] 22:22, 1 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n:No, having just \"Mechanics\" is pointless. Both subfields (if they can even be seen as that!) are certainly important enough to defend their place on the list, and are different enough that they shouldn't only be included as one article. Compare [[:en:Mechanics]] with [[:en:Classical Mechanics]] and [[:en:Quantum Mechanics]].\n:[[User:Andejons|Andejons]] 07:29, 4 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Do we need this kind of lists?== \n\nI think the whole list, and the attempt to great one, is pretty much useless. A decision on topics that should be covered in all the Wikipedias is also very much against the principle idea of having a multi-lingual and \u2013cultural project. Each language project should write primary articles on topics they find important. This way these topics are most likely important for all the speakers of that language, too.\n\nI would present this list more in the spirit: \"if you don\u2019t come-up or run out of ideas of articles you could write in you Wikipedia, you may check this list for some ideas\".\n\nThe title: \"List of articles every Wikipedia should have\" sounds very bad. \n\nThe good news is that whatever there is this kind of list or not, people in different languages will anyway write about the topics that are important for them. Still, it would be nice if the list is presented not with the words \"should have\" - some less-bold people may even take it seriously. --[[User:Teemul|Teemul]] 23:09, 3 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, not only a regional one. This list reflects that by listing 1000 topics that are commonly considered the most important for the whole humanity. As clearly written in the intro, it's not the rule, but an advice what a general encyclopedia should have. Nobody will prevent you from writing about [[:en:Leena Palotie|Leena Palotie]] instead of [[en:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]], but I'm willing to bet that even in Finnish WP much more people will seek information about Darwin than about Palotie. And that's one of the main goals of any encyclopedia - usefulness as a reference. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 09:09, 4 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n== [[:en:Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] ==\n\n[[Image:LocationKazakhstan.png|350px|thumb|right|Location of the Kazakhstan on the World map]]\n[[User:Yerpo]] in [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have&diff=999036&oldid=997016 some day] removed [[:en:Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] from list with some kind of racial prejudice comment: ''...its inclusion here is, frankly, ridiculous''.

It's hard to miss the \"Important note\" at the top of the page saying that. In this respect, it's your edit that could be classified as vandalism, not mine. Secondly, don't try to label my comment as racial prejudice, because I didn't say anything even remotely connected with race. As for your argument, I don't think area and natural resources are enough for making a country one of the 50 most important countries (or even 15, since the first time you [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have&diff=983889&oldid=979814 bolded the entry]). I'll leave the evaluation of regional importance to somebody with more experience in geography and politics.\n\n:As for \"discrimination\", my country currently presides the European Union and is the fastest developing country in the region. Despite that, I wouldn't even think about adding it to the list. Furthermore, it's a part of Central Europe. \n\n: So, I'm sorry if I offended you, but cool your nationalism down, and wait until someone more knowledgeable evaluates the proposition.

About racism: I definitely don't \"hate\" Kazakhstan or Kazakhs, I said I don't mind the inclusion if it's argumented. It just ''has'' to be argumented first and another, less important item removed.

As I see it the 9/11 events were just a consequence, and didn't change anything significantly (although they might have accelerated the turn of events). If you want to include an important topic they were a part of, you should put [[:en:American Empire]] on the list, IMO. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 06:58, 29 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n== More possible articles to be removed (very unpopular ones) ==\n\nI created a [[List of Wikipedias by sample of articles/Neglected#Popular Articles|list of articles sorted by popularity]] and found that articles that are so general to essentially be just definitions are not very popular across wikipedias. I think this is a sign they should be removed.\n \nExamples of unpopular articles:\n*[[en:Country]] \n*[[en:Length]] \n*[[en:Minute]] \n*[[en:Sensory system]] \n*[[en:Juice]] \n*[[en:Female]] \n*[[en:Wedge (mechanics)]] \n*[[en:Male]] \n*[[en:Pronunciation]] \n--[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 07:01, 23 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Country is just silly \u2013 even the English article is short and in many languages the word is fairly synonymous with state, which is much more important and which we already have. (For example, the exact Finnish translation is \"maa\" which means land, country, soil, Earth (Maa) and is appropriately a disambiguation page). Pronunciation should definitely also be removed, it's more suitable for Wiktionary than Wikipedia and is bound to remain stubby in all languages. Not sure about the others \u2013 at least male and female seem fairly fundamental concepts. I also think that we should rename city > town as the latter seems to be a more generic word and the English article has about 90 interwikis as opposed to the 24 in city. Having city is just English-centric as clearly the preferred concept in a vast majority of Wikipedia languages is town. I also support removing deity, per above as it overlaps with god in many languages, and the article has few interwikis. For example, the Finnish article on god begins: \"Jumala, jumaluus tai jumalolento on k\u00e4site, joka...\" (\"God, deity or [another synonym] is a concept, which...\"). --[[User:Orri|Orri]] 18:59, 30 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Also, I think there are problems with the list of countries. It seems arbitrary to have Belgium and the Republic of Ireland, but not Portugal or Sweden or Kazakhstan or Peru. Belgium is culturally sort of a mix between the Netherlands and France, and no mather how great Irish culture is I think that from a non-English-speaking majority view it should be removed. What we should add is '''Nigeria''', instead of Tanzania, a huge African country. IMHO it's practically a crime not to have it. There are some problems with the cities as well. I think we should rather have Delhi than New Delhi \u2013 of course New Delhi is the actual capital, but it's pretty much a part of Delhi itself and Delhi is a much bigger city. [[User:Orri|Orri]] 19:47, 30 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n::I strongly agree about removing these entries. [[User:Hogne|Hogne]] 21:33, 30 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n::Agreed on all counts. [[:en:Male]] and [[:en:Female]] are superfluous as well, because we have [[:en:Sex]] which should explain both as biological phenomena and their interactions (in the biological sense). Only very specific information fit in there, such as the symbol for each sex and what kind of reproductive cells it produces. The \"Sex determination\" chapter has four copies right now, in both sexes' articles, in [[en:Sex]] ''and'' in [[:en:Sex-determination]] system. This really doesn't make sense. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 08:58, 9 July 2008 (UTC)\n\n:::I did a few changes:\n:::*I removed Belgium and added Nigeria: I believe this is justified, because we already have France and the Netherlands and because Nigeria is a huge country, one of the most important in Africa. This also counters the Eurocentric bias.\n:::*I removed country, because it's superfluous to state in many languages, short even in the English Wikipedia and has very few interwikis, so clearly it is hard to translate or not considered important in many languages.\n:::*I removed deity, it's very much superfluous to god in many languages, and several people have talked about this before. It also has relatively few interwikis. I bolded god because of this.\n:::*I also removed male and female. We already have sex, ad apparently also woman and man, discussing these concepts from a human point of view.\n:::*I changed city into town, because this is the preferred concept in a vast majority of languages.\n:::I'm not sure if I was too quick, feel free to discuss here or revert if necessary :) I think that one of the problems with this list is that it's not as universal as it should be \u2013 the English language should only be used as a means to an end, not the starting point. Country, deity and city are prime examples of this: those who have added these words were thinking from an English-language point of view and not checking whether these concepts have the best translations in other languages. --[[User:Orri|Orri]] 21:57, 18 July 2008 (UTC)\n\n:::It seems that the city/town difference is the most difficult of these. In English, city is obviously the more important concept. There are a few languages that make the same difference: Japanese has [[:ja:\u90fd\u5e02]], Arabic has [[:ar:\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629]] (but it links back to town!), Latin has [[:la:urbs]], Icelandic has [[:is:borg]] and of Chinese I'm not sure. Slovene [[:sl:mesto]], Spanish [[:es:ciudad]] and Azeri [[:az:\u015e\u0259h\u0259r]] interwikis should probably be moved from city to town. Italian, Portuguese and Russian have the same interwiki in both articles. French makes the distinction between [[:fr:ville]] and [[:fr:cit\u00e9]], but the latter has a different meaning and ville seems to be the preferred concept. The rest seem to be pretty much in town. Of course, a possible solution would also be to move most of the interwikis into city. --[[User:Orri|Orri]] 22:24, 18 July 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Karl Benz ==\nI got surprised not finding Karl Benz's article on the list but Henry Ford's one. I agree they were both very important engineers in the automotive fields, but Benz is credited as the inventor of the '''first combustion engine-powered automobile''', the 1886 Benz Patent Motorwagen 3/4CV. Also, Mercedes-Benz continues to be one of the leading luxury car makers. If Benz shall not be included on the list, then I'd suggest Nicolas Cugnot, creator of the first automobile ever, the 1769 Fardier \u00e0 Vapeur (though Ferdinand Verbiest could also be credited with his 1672 car design)--[[:w:User:Fluence|Fluence]] 19:47, 28 June 2008 (UTC-5)\n\n== Changing \"butterfly\" ==\n\nI propose changing [[:en:Butterfly]] to [[:en:Lepidoptera]] in this list. There are several reasons: butterflies aren't even a taxonomic group, so the definition itself can be problematic. Furthermore, they have several characteristics (morphology, ecology, life cycle, etc.) that can be generalised to the whole Lepidoptera group; having only a part of them listed as \"important\" promotes duplicating the data when editors feel that an article deemed important should be as long as possible (check the abovementioned pair of articles in english WP). Lastly, many Lepidopterans that aren't butterflies have a substantial impact on humans, mostly as pests. Not to mention that in many languages, the translation for the word \"butterfly\" includes all the species from the ordo Lepidoptera. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 10:56, 7 July 2008 (UTC)\n:Are butterflies that important? I would be in favor of removing it altogether. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 00:07, 16 July 2008 (UTC)\n::I would be in favor of removing it or perhaps switching to a more important insect: [[en:Mosquito]] for transmitting diseases or [[en:Grasshopper]] for causing plagues. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 04:35, 16 July 2008 (UTC)\n:::The Lepidoptera are important as pollinators and pests, and (perhaps most notably) for promoting nature conservation.

Based on [[:en:List of cities proper by population]] and [[:en:List of urban areas by population]], I would suggest the following:\n*Include [[:en:Lagos]], [[:en:Kinshasa]] (both with at least over 7 million residents) [[:en:Kolkata]] (urban area of 15 million) [[:en:Bogot\u00e1]] (over 7 million) and [[:en:Dhaka]] (capital of one of the biggest countries in the world). This also counters the Eurocentric bias.\n*Remove [[:en:Dublin]], [[:en:Edinburgh]], [[:en:Naples]], [[:en:Tel Aviv]] and [[:en:Melbourne]] and/or [[:en:Canberra]]. I can't really think of a reason for including these: with Dublin we might as well have Helsinki, Copenhagen and Stockholm, Edinburgh ''really'' isn't important, we already have Jerusalem from Israel (which is culturally more important) and two cities from Australia is definitely enough if we are only going to have three from China (!!). Italy is great, but three cities is just too much. But this isn't only about size, which is why I'll rather have Kyoto than Osaka and Mecca than Riyadh because of the cultural importance of these cities.\n--[[User:Orri|Orri]] 17:27, 20 July 2008 (UTC)\n\nHere is a breakdown of the list with the proposed changes:\n:Africa: 5 (Sub-Saharan 4).\n:Asia: 20 (Middle East 6, India 3, China 3, Japan 2, Indonesia 1, Bangladesh 1, Pakistan 1, South Korea 1, Thailand 1, Singapore).\n:America: 8 (South 4, North 4).\n:Europe: 12.\n:Australasia: 1\u20132.\nI hope I counted correctly :) Actually now I think that we should remove both Canberra and Melbourne and also Beirut, as the Middle East is overrepresented. --[[User:Orri|Orri]] 17:44, 20 July 2008 (UTC)\n\n:An excellent effort.

But I think [[:en:Leopold von Ranke|Leopold von Ranke]] should be added to the list instead of It\u014d Hirobumi, as it is more influential on earth than It\u014d (It\u014d only influences the East Asia). Or, we can try to expand the list to 2,000 entries so that we can add more important historical figures , present politians, history of a certain country or region and academic terms commonly seen as news media (such as sociology, Westernization, modernization , modernity and postmodernity). Recreational figures should be reduced to 1 or 2 since many traditional encyclopedias rarely give they articles. --[[User:RekishiEJ|RekishiEJ]] 01:50, 26 July 2008 (UTC)\n:::::: Expanding the list is not a good idea. It wouldn't solve the problem of deciding which articles are more important than the other which has to happen with any limit (1000, 2000 or 3000).  It will be more difficult since you will be dealing with lessor known topics and comparing more items. Also, to appear less POV we should try to select people from around the world.

Third, Leopold von Ranke did influence historiography in non-Western countries.

That's almost like saying that Einstein should be removed since he worked at a patent office! He is the source of most of what's known of nordic mythology \u2013 and he could just as well go under \"historian\", since he wrote that as well. Even though he is from \"the western world\", what he's written is in several ways distinctively non-western: a presenter of a culture that was very far removed from the Christian world (even if such themes has crept in).

What I'm trying to say about  Snorri is that he is am important figure for understanding a ccertain part of the world for a certain period of time, and that he ought not be dismissed because he was as a lawspeaker or he is unknown to some people (there are certainly many persons on the list I don't know who they are, but that doesn't make them less important), but because his work is judged not to be important enough. \n:::::::::::::[[User:Andejons|Andejons]] 09:34, 30 July 2008 (UTC)\n:::::::::::::: Maybe, we shall remove [[:en:Sappho]], if there would be no objections?

By the way, Sappho is influential both in the literature history and LGBT terms (lesbian, this word sparked great controversy in Greece since one large female homosexual group want to register the name with \"lesbian\", and people in [[:en:Lesbos|Lesbos]] have long been identified as homosexual, causing them great disruption, thus make a request that lesbian should return to its original meaning and that large group can not use \"lesbian\" in their name), so she is vital. --[[User:RekishiEJ|RekishiEJ]] 21:49, 6 August 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Charles V ==\n\nI suggest to add [[en:Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Holy Roman emperor.

So, the current 1,000 list can be redone: replacing the 200 trivial topics with real articles would make the current 1,000 much more tolerable:\n* replace: ''map, town, continent, man/woman, child, sea, river, bridge, dam''\n* with ''Cartography, Continental drift, Iraq War, X/Y chromosomes, diurnal tides, drainage basin, Brooklyn Bridge, and Aswan Dam''.\nThen include ''President Lyndon Johnson'' and other topics not described in a dictionary. Once each article is treated as a complex topic, not a word in a dictionary, then hundreds of trivial words can be replaced by articles that didn't seem to fit among the 1,000.  For example, take words like \"Color\" and replace with different articles: ''Color spectrum, Color blindness, Primary colors,'' and such.  When reading about \"Color spectrum\", the reader could get the frequency ranges of the various colors that were formerly each considered a vital article.  Avoiding dictionary words (as titles) will release a lot of article titles for more important topics. -[[Special:Contributions/209.214.44.173|209.214.44.173]] 07:15, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n==1000 is just too few==\n''24-Oct-2008:'' After studying the list for years, I finally realized that 1,000 articles is absolutely too small, and perhaps 5,000 would have been much better.  A Wikipedia doesn't need all 5,000 articles immediately, but it would be a long-term goal.  Why did 1,000 fail to cover the range? Because using only 1000 was like trying to represent a \"football field\" in \"3 inches of soil\". It might seem (at first) that grass is still grass in 3 inches, but only one yardline or goal-line could fit within 3 inches, and putting a goal post in there pushes a yardline marker out. Plus, those yardline numbers for 20, 30, 40, 50 won't fit inside a 3-inch plug of grass, and it can't show the \"whole 9 yards\" before the next ''[[:w:first down|first down]]''.  In this analogy, a football field could be better represented in a 10-yard segment (10% of the whole 100-yard field), showing 2 yardlines 10 feet apart, with the goal line, and a chain measuring the 9 yards until the next first down.&nbsp; Likewise, for an encyclopedia, consider listing 10% of a large collection, such as 10% of 50,000 articles = 5,000 articles.\n\nBecause the English Wikipedia is so huge (2.6 million articles), I'm creating a list of [[:w:Wikipedia:Vital_articles/Expanded|10,000 highly notable topics]]: those are the articles that should be improved above \"good-article\" level, because they are the core of a full encyclopedia.  Among those 10,000 articles, will be:\n:* about 250 famous athletes among the top Olympic/sports figures;\n:* over 150 TV/film actors that represent long-term impact;\n:* over 100 major artists of ballet/opera/etc.;\n:* some of the top 50 racehorses of the past 200 years;\n:* many breeds of cat/dog/horse that appear in formal shows;\n:* dozens of food items (intended to span many food cultures);\n:* famous authors, journalists, and mystics around the world.\nEach Wikipedia can reach an international audience, and for that reason, a large set of core articles should be written, long-term.\n\nThe problem has been a lack of scope to show people that the core list covers enough to track the overall progress of expanding the articles. In the past, there was no incentive to improve the 4 articles about actors, when more than 150 actors have had obvious impact in English films.  Now, with a larger list, multiple people can divide the work, each improving \"10 articles\" in the total list, with the understanding that those are the articles that people will be reading, not just the 4 actors in the 1000-list.  I, personally, don't care to push featured-article level, just improve those 10,000 articles to have sources & some significant details in each. If there are some awkward phrases or weak sections, that is close enough.  I feel that the featured-article requirement, to expand all weak sections, can be overkill, if the basic details are already present in an article.\n\nAnyway, the most important point is that the 1000-list is absolutely too small (someone tried a 1300-article list, but it got trimmed back down).  Instead, list 5,000 or 10,000 major articles, and allow each Wikipedia to take years developing those articles as a long-term goal.  Each Wikipedia could decide how to prioritize articles that have lower impact for their readers, but don't try to cram 500 years of stage acting into 4 people, or 4500 years of scientific progress into 30 people, etc.  Quite honestly, the 1000-list approach is just plain \"goofy\" as a measure of information, or as someone above said, the effect \"seems psychotic\" because it's mentally unbalanced, like trying to cram the football field into 3 inches of soil (as a measure of \"how to construct a football field\").  More yards are needed, and more articles are needed to clarify what is involved in building the thing. -[[Special:Contributions/209.214.44.173|209.214.44.173]] 07:15, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n:See [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have#Why 1000?|my above reply]]. Any number we'd set would be completely subjective and not much less psychotic to conform to (especially when people decided to cram dozens of ''racehorses'' in). Remember, there's a difference between \"important\" and \"notable\", and what is hugely popular in the English-speaking world (or even USA alone) may be almost unknown in other parts of the world (such as baseball, rugby and racehorses), hence globally unimportant.

Note now, Wikimedia can do calculations: code as <code><nowiki>\"{{#expr: 50000 / 1009 round 2}}\"</nowiki><code> (result: average notable articles omitted for each listed article: {{#expr: 50000 / 1009 round 2}}, rounded to 2 places). Remember, Wikimedia is a vast computing tool as well as repository.  The MediaWiki software can perform thousands of calcs per second, and there is no need to shorten the list if Wikimedia does the calcs.\n\n''Listing 2000 is easier:'' However, we could add 1,000 entries (as 2,000 total), to allow mentally dividing by 1,000 and halving, as division by 2000.  So, yes, 2000 articles would be easier to hand-calculate than 1009, and I vote YES to quickly expand the list to 2,000 for easy calculations. To pad as 2000 entries, insert the periodic table of atomic elements (or such) as filler, then delete elements from the end to keep the list as 2,000 when more entries are added. Certainly, every Wikipedia should have the (universal) atomic elements, but the end (radioactive) elements are not as notable, and easily deleted. I would also add hundreds of Nobel Prize winners, since that is a worldwide concern, and showcases world technologies and styles. Another form of quick filler could be a list of Olympic sporting events (which applies to the whole world), and then delete from that list as space is needed.  Wikimedia is recommending only the minimum, and anyone can list ALL the atomic elements (or Olympic events) in their encyclopedia, even those not in a 2000-article core list.  Beware that it won't take long to find 2000 world-wide important articles, so the next hand-calculation is 5000 articles: multiply by 2 and shift 4 places (.0000), to divide by 5000. -[[Special:Contributions/209.214.44.173|209.214.44.173]] 09:49, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n:{{oppose}}, as per [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have#1000 is just too few|comment above]]. The ease of calculation isn't by any chance an important argument here IMO, eventhough it has been mentioned. Would be good to have another opinion, though. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 11:36, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n:{{oppose}}, if an expanded list is needed (which I don't think so) it should be seperate from this one. Articles have different importance. Something people have to accept for any size list to make sense. But once you accept that, its just a matter of sorting and truncating. But I believe we should leave it at 1000 articles. Its small enough to force people to filter the list by importance, large enough to be a starting point for balanced coverage, and yet a doable task for new wiki. -[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 20:49, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n:{{oppose}} I think that writing 1,000 articles is enough work for a new wiki. For example, in the [http://gl.wikipedia.org Galician wikipedia], we have created more than 40,000 articles after five years; but there are still a few articles from the 1,000 list waiting to be written. [[User:Miguel.lima|Miguel.lima]] 16:19, 26 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n:{{oppose}} However, I would be in favor of a second list of articles as the \"second thousand articles every Wikipedia should have.\" -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 12:19, 29 October 2008 (UTC)\n* ''27-Oct-2008:'' Thanks, everyone, for your replies.  I see now that the list can be interpreted as articles that a Wikipedia language \"must have\" (rather than \"should have\"), and the German Wikipedia had just 984 articles in their variation as the core list for German.  I have only recently viewed the [[List of Wikipedias by sample of articles/Absent Articles|Absent-Articles listing]] (which limits reporting to those Wikipedias which have omitted fewer than 250 from the total list): if the list were much longer, then absent-article counts could exceed the 250 (dropping those Wikipedias from the list), and there would be less information about which articles are slow to implement. Currently, I see that \"everyone\" has the very-famous people, such as Beethoven, Dvorak, Puccini, Verdi, Einstein, Elvis, Marilyn, The Beatles, Spielberg, Fellini, Kubrick, Walt Disney, Florence Nightingale, [[en:Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]] and [[en:Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], plus common terms such as Week, Month, Year, Kilometre, Foot, Kilogram, Litre, [[en:Polytheism|Polytheism]], [[en:Football (soccer)|Football]], [[en:Baseball|Baseball]], [[en:Rugby|Rugby]] & [[en:Game|Game]]. Obviously, many Wikipedias omit the less-known people (such as American [[en:Walt Whitman]], [[en:Satyajit Ray]], or [[en:Abu Nuwas]]) and expensive activities (like [[en:Horse racing]] or [[en:Auto racing]]). However, the least-favorite articles include the abstract/broad concepts, such as [[en:Reality|Reality]], [[en:Thought|Thought]], [[en:Writing|Writing]], [[en:Prose|Prose]], [[en:Fiction|Fiction]], [[en:Behavior|Behavior]], [[en:Beauty|Beauty]], [[en:Truth|Truth]], [[en:Morality|Morality]], [[en:Domestication|Domestication]] & [[en:Measurement|Measurement]].  Perhaps keep the list around 1000-1200, but avoid abstract terms and unusual people, thereby allowing each Wikipedia to add their own notable people in their realm. Certainly, a list of 2000 would be too many when treated as the \"required\" core list. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] 12:57, 27 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n==Whale is idiosyncratic to English==\nThe term and concept ''whale'' in the list should be replaced with ''cetacea''. Whale may be an important concept in English. But the definition in the article in the English wikipedia shows that the concept is awkward and arbitrary delinated. Notably it is not a taxon in Biology. It does not have interwiki link to Danish, Swedish or Norwegian (closely related to English). I think this is because these languages lack corresponding words. Cetacea, on the other hand, does have a corresponding Swedish word that seems to be ethymologically related to ''whale'' (''val''). --[[Special:Contributions/194.237.142.6|194.237.142.6]] 18:28, 30 October 2008 (UTC)\n:The term ''[[:en:Cetacea|cetacea]]'' includes whales and dolphins. So, it overlaps with having ''Dolphin'' in the list. I would actually prefer having either [[:en:Blue Whale]] (\"largest animal ever to have existed\") or [[:en:Sperm Whale]] (\"largest living toothed animal\" and of [[:en:Moby Dick]] fame). The en.wp ''cetacea'' article mainly lists the various species of the order which doesn't seem to be an article every wikipedia should have. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 05:43, 31 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n::Articles about ''cetacea'' are featured on four different language versions, so it's certainly possible to write good articles about the subject. Also, even en:Whale mostly deals with things that could just as well be in the article about the order (it even mentions dolphins as a type of whale). \n::[[User:Andejons|Andejons]] 09:31, 1 November 2008 (UTC)\n\n:::I agree with the above and have made the change. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 18:27, 2 November 2008 (UTC)\n\n::::Thanks, Yerpo. Indeed, the English concept of 'whale', does present its problems as it's not a biological term, while Swedish 'valar' (plural form of 'val') is both about biology and general concept (ref. the old Swedish biological term 'valdjur' is not used nowadays, making 'valar' a term with at least two definitions). Same problems arise in languages such as Catalan (where 'balena' primarily means a baleen whale) and probably in Arabic, both Wikipedias carrying an current \"Absent value\" of 1 to 2. So, making English language/the English language Wikipedia the model for all Wikipedias does have its ups and downs. Then, thanks once more, Yerpo.--[[User:Paracel63|Paracel63]] 15:07, 15 November 2008 (UTC)\n\n== The final squeeze ==\n\nAccording to the count, we are approaching our goal.

Instead I propose that Agriculture be moved from the section on business and economics, to the section on technology. Although the business and economic side of agriculture is very important, fundamentally agriculture concerns the production of food and other products of the land. It is true that business and economics were largely built upon a foundation of agriculture. However, agriculture exists outside of business and economics, subsistence agriculture still being a way of life for some. Agriculture, though, depends completely on technology, to plant, harvest and store crops. So, could we place agriculture under technology, where irrigation stands now, and have irrigation and plough as subsections of agriculture? [[User:Lloffiwr|Lloffiwr]] 19:08, 7 November 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Sounds logical to me. I don't think anyone would mind if you just do it. --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 09:04, 8 November 2008 (UTC)\n\n::OK. Done.

Perhaps there is and idiosyncratic term or two left, the section proportions aren't perfect (still too many biographies, for example) and some of the entries are too vague to have large articles on (especially in the Philosophy section). But instead of bashing our heads in attempt to solve this, I propose to make this version official (v1.1) so people can translate it to their own languages. Then we can start solving the problems which will take more effort, IMO. What do you think? --[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] 10:16, 11 November 2008 (UTC)\n:It looks good enough to be version 1.1 and it might be good to see how easy these are to translate to other languages. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 03:22, 12 November 2008 (UTC)\n\nAny other opinions?

I am very interested to know the opinion of the person who made that cut (Akigka) as to why that happened?

Personally I think there are more important authors than Gibran and Mahfouz (maybe [[:en:Abu Nuwas]]?). --[[User:Ecelan|Ecelan]] 22:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n:: You are right. The latest cuts were solely intended to get the list down to 200 entries and were mostly arbitrary. A further revision of the list is absolutely needed. It still stands, however, that to keep this list at a practical 1000 entries an addition should be accompanied by an elimination. If you suggest keeping the biographies of these two authors, could you also indicate which entries to eliminate instead? We still need to eliminate over 100 entries to get the entire list down to 1000, but I guess that 200 biographies is reasonable (although initially they were supposed to be only 100). --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 15:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)\n::: Problem is Akigka, I have no clue as to how the English-language authors measure up (I dont know for instance whether Proust is more important or Poe :) ), I only know that right now there are no Arabic ones on that list. --[[User:Shipmaster|Shipmaster]] 00:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n::Ecelan, while I am no authority on the subject, I can confidently say that [[:en:Naguib Mahfouz|Mahfouz]] is the most famous and influential contemporary author, as for contemporary Poets, [[:en:Nizar Qabbani|Nizar Qabbani]] and [[:en:Khalil Gibran|Gibran]] I think are the most well known.

I see two possible interpretations for the scope of this project:\n\n1: articles that ought to exist in every Wikipedia\n2: articles that ought to exist in every Wikipedia but might not otherwise (so no need to include articles that will naturally be written without guidance)\n\nI favour the former, but accept a certain validity in the latter. However, that\u2019s a long way from what I see this list to be. I\u2019d like to encourage everyone to consider the needs of a minority language speaker, someone for whom their Wikipedia will be one of the only sources of online information.

I\u2019d contend that no article should be added to the list without consideration of the readership in this way.\n\nAddendum: I feel that the list ought to contain a slight bias towards explanations of current events, as minority language speakers may have no access to anything approaching an informed and unbiased news source. \nArticles should also be included on issues where other information available may be prejudiced, e.g. women\u2019s rights, medicine, other human rights, cases of minority languages attaining workable legal status, health risks common in less developed regions, justice, etc.\n\n[[User:200.107.50.82|200.107.50.82]] 06:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)swyves\n\n: Hmmm. Why is it not this list? I agree that in many ways the current list is somewhat arbitrary and will not likely ever be finished in any sense, but I contend that any list of this kind will necessarily be arbitrary. I don't think there is any surefire way of making an unbiased, universally useful list of 1000 articles that every language edition of Wikipedia should have. I think your point about taking the point of view of minority languages is very valid, as I believe the usefulness of this list lies mainly in how it can be a tool for helping along small wikipedia projects (and hence my stress on keeping it at ''only'' 1000 articles). It seems obvious to me that this list becomes useless once all of the entries on it have been created by a certain wikipedia, and hence, that it is hardly of any consequence for the larger wikipedias, such as the English one. I think you should maybe suggest what kind of changes you'd like to see done here. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 13:46, 21 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n== To rename section \"Religion\" into \"World view\" ==\nI am sorry for bad English. IMHO section \"Religion\" need to rename into \"World view\".\n\"Atheism\" is very strange to placed in \"Religion\" section. If to speak about worldview, their list is necessary. I offer the following list:\n# World view\n# Worldview philosophies \n## Atheism\n## Materialism\n## Monotheism\n## Polytheism\n## Fundamentalism\n\nWord \"Festival\" in English language has religious interpretation probably. But in Russian and Ukrainian \"Festival\" does not associate in any way with religion. IMHO It is not necessary to include such individual interpretation for all languages and delete from this section. --[[User:Klip game|Klip game]] 09:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)\n: This is a very valid suggestion. However, I am compelled to remove six of your entries since they pushed the number of articles to 1006 (1007 actually, but someone was kind enough to remove [[:en:Compact disc]] since then). Hence the list is six entries too long. I am very adamant about keeping the list at exactly 1000 entries, as it has a certain inbuilt tendency to grow out of every proportion and hence becoming useless for smaller wikipedias (for which it is intended) when the mere task of translating it becomes monumental (leaving aside the task of creating articles for all these entries). I therefore suggest that you remove six entries that you think are less important than the ones you added to round the list back to 1000 entries or (better) suggest deletions here that they may be discussed. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 15:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)\n:: I just removed [[:en:Jesus Christ]] as there is already an entry for [[:en:Christianity]] (and because I think we should limit religious articles to articles about the specific religions - and not include founders, creeds, temples, holy books etc.) Hence the list should be only five entries too long. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 15:55, 25 January 2007 (UTC)\n:::I think [[:en:Jesus Christ]] as thinker is more popular, than [[en:Rosa Luxemburg]] or [[en:Simone de Beauvoir]]. --[[User:Igrek|Igrek]] 08:50, 26 January 2007 (UTC)\n::::In the Christian world, yes. My reason is that the most basic article would be about the religion and from that article articles about important leaders, holy books, holy people, holy sites etc would naturally flow. I think that if we include Jesus Christ there is no reason not to include other important founders of religions such as Buddha and Mohammed, to name but two, and the end result will be a bloated section with way too many entries. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 09:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)\n:::::I propose to include [[en:Jesus Christ]] instead of [[en:Paul of Tarsus]] or other christian thinker and include Buddha and Mohammed instead other religious thinkers.

They directly affect nearly every person and indirectly do affect everyone. This cannot be said for many other entries on the list, such as individuals, etc. I think Politics should also be renamed politics and government to be more general, and Taxes could be an entry there. We don't need to include all the detailed tax arcana, but as sub entries, income taxes, VAT, and property taxes would likely be able to meet any importance criteria to be added as well. The latter two might not be as important, as perhaps not as many jurisdictions levy them, but they still directly affect vast numbers of people. As above I think individuals are the lowest hanging fruit to remove if we need to keep the list at 1,000. So the proposed additions would be\n:1.[[en:Tax]]\n::1. [[en:Income tax]]\n::2. [[en:Value added tax]]\n::3. [[en:Property tax]]\nI reallize with my interests, this could look self serving, but as above I think they meet objective criteria for inclusion. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] 19:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)\n* I propose to add [[en:Tax]] only, this article has links to other articles. --[[User:Igrek|Igrek]] 14:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)\n:*The same would apply to a very large number of entries on the list. Why would being linked from other articles be a criteria? By that we would just have a link to [[en:War|War]] for example, and no specific wars, and many similar examples. What we have to look at is impact and importance. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] 23:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)\n::IMHO The taxes are in any state. It is importance. But the taxes are be different from the country. On Ukraine there is no Property tax, and the Income tax has other importance than for USA. I support to add [[en:Tax]] only. --[[User:Klip game|Klip game]] 09:35, 7 February 2007 (UTC)\n\n== Languages ==\nI am amazed that [[:en:Interlingua|Interlingua]] is in this list. Its proponents are very good at publicity (on a shoestring, too) but its importance is minute compared with that of [[:en:Malay language|Malay language]], [[:en:Portuguese language|Portuguese language]], [[:en:Swahili language|Swahili language]], none of which is listed: all three have tens of millions of speakers in many countries.\n\nLooking at the classic languages that are listed at present, there may perhaps be too many of them. I would squeeze out [[:en:Hebrew language|Hebrew language]], I think; if adding (but there is probably no room to add), I would add [[:en:Pali language|Pali language]].\n\nWould anyone object if I took Interlingua out and added Malay? [[User:Andrew Dalby|Andrew Dalby]] 18:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)\n:As long as you don't increase the total number of articles, I would be happy ;-) Personally I would put Portuguese, Hebrew and Swahili ahead of Interlingua, Pali and Malay, but I'm no language expert. --[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] 11:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)\n:: Hebrew deserves a place as the original language of most of the Bible.--[[User:Poetlister|Poetlister]] 18:51, 1 January 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Suggestion: Kalevala ==\nI suggest [[Kalevala]] would be added to list. As the Finnish national epos it is the flagship of one of the richest oral traditions in the world - the Finnic mythology. About hundred thousand folk poems have been collected from Finnic peoples to the folk poem archive of Finland. Kalevala, even while it haves only a small portion of those poems, represents all that. It is written in a unique European language and unique metre. In Kalevala there are layers of mythology from all time perioids since stone age. It is translated in many languages. There is nothing else about Finland in this list of articles even though Finland is one of the leading countries in welfare, health care, fight against corruption, education, womens rights, democracy, technological achievements, journalist freedom, economic competitiveness and so on (look statistics at the Finland article). There is nothing about any Fenno-Ugric people in this list even though most scientist agree that Fenno-Ugric languages were spoken at Northern Europe before Indo-European languages and so Fenno-Ugrics are native European languages and an important part of what Europeans are composed of just like Christianity or Hellenic culture. If we don't have anything else about Fenno-Ugric world here lets have Kalevala to represent all that. [[User:193.65.112.51|193.65.112.51]] 00:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)\n: I don't think that we should add anything just so that Finland or any other country gets its representation.  The Kalevala is known in other countries, but it is not in the same league as Homer's Iliad.  I have, however, added Sibelius as he undoubtedly deserves a place in any list of the World's greatest symphonists.--[[User:Poetlister|Poetlister]] 18:50, 1 January 2008 (UTC)\n\n== I made some changes ==\n\nI think Napoleon, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar are important enough to be bold.

I think it would be beneficial if it were moved in its entirety to the bottom of the list. The whole list has grown to 1070: nothing serious yet, but a sure sign that the true challenge of a list of this kind is not ''coming up with'' the 1000 topics that every wikipedia ''should have'', but coming up with ''the 1000'' topics that every wikipedia should have. I mean that the main challenge here is keeping the list at 1000, not thinking of topics that it should contain.

If we cannot make this list global and balanced, it is, imho, pretty useless to non-western languages. It may even become another ''sort colonialist'' attempt. (if you know a better word, please feel free to replace \"sort of colonialist\")\n:* Also, it is western-science, western-culture/entertainment biased. I am very certain, being a Westener myself, that our more central interests in our lifes are only parially shared outside our world. Though I'm not knowledgeable enough to voice more than faint guesses, I must assume that in comparison with anglo-european religious philosphers, technical scrientists, reigns, and actors, the subject matters of hygiene, family, household, basic water and food supply, growing crops and livestock, raising children, family economics, environment and nature, etc. are of much higher interest elsewhere.\n:--[[User:Purodha|Purodha Blissenbach]] 10:34, 22 July 2007 (UTC)\n::What if the Western contribution to global civilisation has simply been the most substantial or at least the most influential one? Similar to what happened to the UNESCO World Heritage list, a 'more global' approach may lead to the inclusion of entries of very different relevance for the sake of achieving 'balance'. If the US has produced 2 or more film directors worth mentioning among the '1000' and, say, Indonesia not a single one, this may just be a fact to be accepted rather than an instance of pro-Western bias. The whole trouble is that aesthetic judgements (''Goethe is a better writer than Schiller'') have been made taboo unless they represent some poorly reflected, but universally accepted 'canon of importance'.--[[Special:Contributions/84.190.16.42|84.190.16.42]] 09:38, 22 March 2008 (UTC)\n:::And what if it hasn't?  For example, the list of Music Genres includes New Age (hardly a great contribution to global civilisation, in my opinion), but (with the possible exception of Reggaae) includes no non-western genres.  I suppose Folk could be a catch-all that includes some non-western music, but it wouldn't include major genres such as Indian Classical music.  And that's just one example out of many.

Bach, Beatles, Beethoven, Berlioz, Bruckner, Brahms, Chopin, Dvorak, Handel, Hendrix, Mahler, Mozart, Puccini, Presley, Rolling Stones, Schubert, Sibelius, Smetana, Schumann, Stravinsky, Tchaikovski, Verdi, Vivaldi, Wagner&mdash;is a congeries of items having vastly variable historical value: some were more important than others, and some were less important than ''omitted'' composers. Perhaps the list was compiled by contributors who learned their music from concerts & recordings (which of course reflect particular markets), or who may have been pushing certain parochial favorites; but whatever the cause, its historical perspective is skewed: it overweights recent centuries, and thereby doesn't comprehend the full range of the field. It's exclusively a list of ''Western'' (mostly ''European'') composers & entertainers, none of them prominent more than 300 years ago. For a universal encyclopedia, the list has at least two basic problems: (1) it lacks personages from all the important traditions of the world; (2) it omits known composers who've proved exceedingly important in influencing the evolution of music (and it includes some who fall short of that criterion). In other words, it's unbalanced with regard to ''space'' (problem 1) and with regard to ''time'' (problem 2). I can't address the first problem at the moment, but let's work at solving the second.\n\nFirst, remove the popular entertainers (Presley, Elvis, born 1935; Beatles, The, ca. 1941; Hendrix, Jimi, 1942; Rolling Stones, The, ca. 1943). Of these, the Beatles may have the best claim to be on this list, as perhaps composers at the tertiary level (see below), but these entries belong in another category altogether&mdash;one that might include [[:en:Louis Armstrong]], [[:en:Francis Albert \"Frank\" Sinatra]], [[:en:\u00c9dith Piaf]], [[:en:Christy's Minstrels]], and any of numerous other popular entertainers (like [[en:Fred Astaire]] and [[en:Ginger Rogers]] and [[en:Harry Houdini]], [[:en:Charles Sherwood Stratton]], and so on). Rename the category as '''Composers.'''\n\nNow let's put the composers who've influenced the evolution of (Western) music in better historical perspective. Let's arbitrarily limit the list to twenty. I offer twenty such suggestions below, embedded in a much longer&mdash;but still exceedingly incomplete!&mdash;list, with the names of additional potentially important composers, all ranked in four classes: the ten\u2021 most important for the history of Western music (flushleft, in boldface), first-rank composers (flushleft), secondary composers (one tab to the right), and tertiary composers (two tabs to the right). I've put the names in birth-order. This ranking is highly tentative (I might tweak it from hour to hour!), and others will disagree in many particulars, but I'd expect a consensus on at least half of the twenty. If you sample a hundred well-qualified professors of music history, it's unlikely that they'll agree that, for example, as the current list implies, Bed\u0159ich Smetana was one of The Twenty Most Important Composers Of All Time. It may also be unlikely that such a sample of experts would move the other third-ranked composers into the boldfaced first rank and vice versa. The list omits composers under the age of 80 only because they're too close to our time, and sorting out the evolution of (Western) music after the Second World War may be premature; for a similar and even more conservative reason, nobody is boldfaced after Verdi & Wagner.\n\n:Adam of St. Victor, d. 1146\n:Leoninus, fl. mid-to-late 12th century<br>\nPerotinus, fl. late 12th century\n::Wolfram von Eschenbach, ca. 1170\n::Vogelweide, Walther von der, ca. 1170\n:Halle, Adam de la, ca. 1237<br>\nVitry, Philippe de, 1291<br>\n<b>Machaut, Guillaume de,</b> ca. 1300\n:Bologna, Jacopo da, early 14th century\n:Landini, Francesco, ca. 1325\n::Ciconia, Johannes, ca. 1335\n::Power, Leonel, 1370-85\n::Cordier, Baude, ca. 1380\n:Dunstaple, John, ca. 1390\n<b>Dufay, Guillaume,</b> 1397\n:Binchois, Gilles, ca. 1400\nOckeghem, Johannes, ca. 1410\n:Busnois, Antoine, ca. 1430\n<b>Josquin des Prez,</b> ca. 1450\n:Isaac, Heinrich, 1450-55\n:Obrecht, Jacob, ca. 1457\n:Willaert, Adrian, ca. 1490\n:Tallis, Thomas, ca. 1505\n::Galilei, Vincenzo, ca. 1520\n<b>Palestrina, Giovanni Pierluigi,</b> 1525\n:Lassus, Orlande de, ca. 1532\n:Byrd, William, 1534-43\n:Victoria, Tom\u00e1s Luis de, 1548 \n::Peri, Jacopo, 1561\n::Sweelinck, Jan Pieterszoon, 1562\n::Gesualdo, Carlo, ca. 1566\n<b>Monteverdi, Claudio,</b> 1567\n:Frescobaldi, Girolamo, 1583\nSch\u00fctz, Heinrich, 1585\n:Scheidt, Samuel, 1587\n::Froberger, Johann Jakob, 1616\n:Lully, Jean-Baptiste de, 1632\n:Buxtehude, Dieterich, ca. 1637\n:Charpentier, Marc-Antoine, 1643\n::Biber, Heinrich Ignaz Franz von, 1644\n:Corelli, Arcangelo, 1653\n::Pachelbel, Johann, 1653\n:Purcell, Henry, 1659\n:Scarlatti, Alessandro, 1660\n:Couperin, Fran\u00e7ois,  1668\n::Albinoni, Tomaso Giovanni, 1671\n:Vivaldi, Antonio, 1678\n:Telemann, Georg Philipp, 1681\n:Rameau, Jean-Philippe, 1683\n<b>Bach, Johann Sebastian,</b> 1685\n:Handel, Georg Frideric, 1685\n::Scarlatti, Giuseppe Domenico, 1685\n:Johann Adolph Hasse, 1699\n::Stamitz, Johann Wenzel Anton, 1713\n:Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel, 1714\n:Gluck, Christoph Willibald, 1714\n:Haydn, Franz Joseph, 1732\n:Bach, Johann Christian, 1735\n<b>Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus,</b> 1756<br>\n<b>Beethoven, Ludwig van,</b> 1770\n:Weber, Carl Maria von, 1786\n:Rossini, Gioacchino, 1792\n:Schubert, Franz, 1797\n::Bellini, Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco, 1801\n:Berlioz, Hector, 1803\n::Glinka, Mikhail Ivanovich, 1804\n:Mendelssohn, Felix, 1809\n::Chopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, 1810\n:Schumann, Robert, 1810\n<b>Verdi, Giuseppe,</b> 1813<br>\n<b>Wagner, Richard,</b> 1813\n:Bruckner, Anton, 1824\n::Smetana, Bed\u0159ich, 1824\n::Gottschalk, Louis Moreau, 1829\nBrahms, Johannes, 1833\n:Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Charles Camille, 1835<br>\nTchaikovsky, Petr, 1840\n::Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Anton\u00edn, 1841\n::Sullivan, Arthur Seymour, 1842\n:Rimsky-Korsakov, Nikolai Andreyevich, 1844\n::Widor, Charles-Marie Jean Albert, 1844\n::Faur\u00e9, Gabriel Urbain, 1845\n::Sousa, John Philip, 1854\n:Elgar, Edward, 1857\n:Puccini, Giacomo, 1858\n:Mahler, Gustav, 1860<br>\nDebussy, Achille-Claude, 1862\n:Strauss, Richard Georg, 1864\n::Sibelius, Jean, 1865\n::Joplin, Scott, 1867-68\n::Vaughan Williams, Ralph, 1872\n::Rachmaninoff, Sergei Vasilievich, 1873\n:Ives, Charles Edward, 1874<br>\nSchoenberg, Arnold, 1874\n:Ravel, Joseph-Maurice, 1875<br>\nBart\u00f3k, B\u00e9la Viktor J\u00e1nos, 1881<br>\nStravinsky, Igor, 1882\n::Var\u00e8se, Edgard Victor Achille Charles, 1883\n:Webern, Anton, 1883\n:Berg, Alban, 1885\n::Villa-Lobos, Heitor, 1887\n:Prokofiev, Sergei Sergeyevich, 1891\n::Hindemith, Paul, 1895\n::Thomson, Virgil, 1896\n::Poulenc, Francis Jean Marcel, 1899\n::Copland, Aaron, 1900\n:Shostakovich, Dmitri Dmitriyevich, 1906\n:Messiaen, Olivier, 1908\n::Boulez, Pierre, 1925\n::Stockhausen, Karlheinz, 1928\n\nN.B.

If I had to demote one of the top twenty, it might have to be Ockeghem. If I had to promote one from the second to the first rank, it might have to be&mdash;if not Leoninus or Landini&mdash;Lully, mainly because he was so important in setting the style of French music at the court of Louis XIV (a style that lasted long after he died and had influence well beyond France). One could similarly quibble against or in favor of many of the other nonprimary names.\n\n\u2021Ten? Better forty or fifty?! Anyone competent in the history of Western music should be able to say something pertinent about ''each'' name on the list above. [[User:J. W. Love|J. W.

All of these articles will appear on the English-language and Spanish-language wikipedias in time; as i understand it, the aim of this list is to put together 1000 articles that should appear in all those little wikipedias, that maybe don't even have 1000 articles yet.\n\nNow, there are two classes of minority language speaker -- those who are also fluent in a majority language (say, Hawaiian-speakers or Welsh-speakers who also speak English) and those who are not, such as speakers of languages peculiar to small regions, often in the developing world. In the first case, the minor language Wikipedia is a project to keep the language alive, and that is a noble goal; but I suggest that it is those who have no other recourse to information to whom we owe the greatest consideration.\n\nThe people who speak minority languages are often looked down on as uneducated fools, and their rights are not respected by employers, landowners, government workers, etc. They have very little access to information, as even though they may be able to use the internet (cybercafes are ubiquitous in the andean highlands), there are very few pages that they are capable of understanding; an employer, knowing that a worker is unaware of her rights, is often not quick to inform her. In the regions where I have been active, literacy is not uncommon but any education beyond primary level is very rare. \n\nHaving spent over 7 years working with people who speak minor Andean and Amazonian languages such as Quechua, Aymara and Yagua, there are certain questions that I am asked all the time, things that a very large number of people are interested in. These might include questions about the country they live in, the government and government systems, modern technology, agriculture (the occupation of the overwhelming majority), the law, childcare, and, most of all, health and medicine. \"What is this drug that I have been given?\" \"Should my kid be able to talk by his age?\" \"What is the internet and what can it do for me?\" \"What is the Free Trade Agreement, and will it mean that I can no longer sell my crops?\"\n\nIn seven years, I can safely say that I have never been asked about Urdu, Fencing, or Ernst Haeckel.\n\nThis list is a beautiful thing. It might be, for instance, a list of articles that all Wikipedians should read, a kind of culturally universal education. However, it smacks of educational imperialism to say that these are the articles that must be available to minority language speakers. \n\nOf course, in a sense, any list compiled in English but for minority language speakers will suffer the same criticism. The ideal would be to go to those people and ask them what they would like to know. Had we a little funding, we could put together a proper survey.\n\nHowever, without investing any money, I have put together a starter list here, based largely on personal experience and follow-on logic. I was considering deleting the entire current list and substituting in this one (be bold!). However, for the moment, I haven't: I don't mean disrespect to the many users who have joined forces to make a very valuable list, albeit one that is misnamed and misplaced. Later, I (or rather, we) should -- based on criteria of interest (are people actually going to access the article) and utility (will they learn something important from it).\n\nThe list that I'm putting forward might seem biased towards medicine. That's partially because it is important and of interest to the people we are working for, but also because of the way that the articles seemed to fit. An article on Human Rights ought to be long, highly considered, well-informed and well-written; an article on amoxicillin might be stub-class, just a few links to antibiotic, rheumatic fever, medicine, and conditions for which it is or is not indicated. I think that there is much room for improvement and expansion, particularly in sections regarding law, human rights, agriculture, NGOs, international organizations, etc. \n\nHere, then, is my suggestion for a new start.\n\nswyves\n[[Special:Contributions/190.21.185.49|190.21.185.49]] 01:30, 19 November 2007 (UTC)\n\n{|\n|-

I definitely agree about keyboard, monitor, mouse, and browser.\n\nSome odd points I've seen:\n* [[:en:Sensory system]], with articles about [[:en:Auditory system]], [[:en:gustatory system]], [[:en:olfactory system]], [[:en:somatosensory system]], and [[:en:visual system]]. I'd say, just chop this down to \"sensory system\", and include the important sense-organs.\n* Articles for both [[:en:China]] and [[:en:People's Republic of China]]? Let's pick one.\n*If we have [[:en:Burj Dubai]], we can delete [[:en:CN Tower]] and [[:en:Sears Tower]]. I also say delist [[:en:Petronas Twin Towers]].\n*I think [[:en:George W. Bush]] should be removed, as I noted above.\n* I'm unsure about [[:en:Protist]].\n* I'm not sure if we need [[:en:Mobile telephone]] if we already have [[:en:Telephone]]\n* I'm not sure about [[:en:Madonna]] and [[:en:Michael Jackson]]\n* The 1990-91 [[:en:Gulf War]] seems pretty lame compared to the current conflict there.\n* Why [[:en:Montreal]], [[:en:Toronto]], [[:en:Vancouver]] and [[:en:Chicago]]? They are important, but there are more significant cities in North America, and we already have several examples in the west.\n* Do we need all three: Microeconomics, Macroekonomics, and Economics? I say, narrow it down to just [[:en:Economics]] and throw out the other two.\n* [[:en:Syntax]] could maybe be covered in [[:en:Grammar]]\n* If we have [[:en:Addiction]], do we need \"drug addiction\" and \"alcoholism\"?\n* Who in the heck is [[:en:Verner Geisenberg]]? On the list, and no article in the English or German?\n* Probably can delete [[:en:Stephen Harper]], but maybe keep [[:en:John A. Macdonald]].\n* I'd like to see George Lucas and Steven Spielberg dropped for maybe someone from a different culture... Who's the best, most legendary director of \"Bollywood\"? (Not my area of expertise.)\n-- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 15:15, 13 December 2007 (UTC)\n\nOther things I might drop:\n* [[:en:Rugby union]]\n* [[:en:Badminton]]\n* [[:en:Interlingua]] (but keep [[:en:Esperanto]]\n* [[:en:Lake Titicaca]]\n* [[:en:Tigris]] & [[:en:Euphrates]] (but keep [[:en:Mesopotamia]])\n* [[:en:Wright Brothers]]\n-- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 11:34, 14 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n:If there's no objections, I'll probably try to start trimming some of these back, maybe starting with the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have&diff=753906&oldid=752705 contributions of Johnny Au], since he didn't come to the discussion first. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 19:11, 17 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n::I agree with most of your comments, but I'd like it to be a stable version after dropping these items. I'll probably also drop [[:en:Nuclear force]], I think it's not what people thought it had to be (this article refers to residual strong force, not even strong interaction, which would be more basic). --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 09:37, 18 December 2007 (UTC)\n:::It could be replaced with [[:en:Radioactivity]]. --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 14:08, 18 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n:[[:en:Verner Geisenberg]] is probably supposed to be [[:en:Werner Heisenberg]] --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.2.62|140.180.2.62]] 19:47, 4 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Moving goal posts? ==\n\nHi there. I'd like to register a bit of a complaint. Back in October, I went through the exhaustive process of translating this list to the Esperanto Wikipedia, so we could fill in the few gaps we had left. Now that were pretty much done, I notice that [[User:Johnny Au]] has added Canadian Prime Ministers and Canadian Cities, and other questionably important features of Canada, which probably should have been discussed first. Normally I thought list items should be brought up on the discussion page first, but these people just made edits without consulting the community on the talk page. Also brought up without discussion were [[:en:El Greco]], [[:en:Johannes Vermeer]], [[:en:M. C. Escher]], [[:en:Chicken]], [[:en:Saint-Petersburg]], [[:en:Chicago]], and the list goes on.  No doubt all of these are important, but the folks adding them should have brought them up here to figure out something to replace them with, since we are way over our budget of 1000 articles. Also I found [[en:Verner Geisenberg]] was added, and I can't find anything on that name in Google except for chatter on Wikipedia wondering who it is?! (We at the Esperanto Wikipedia actually had most of these, but it's a pain for me to constantly update our list of articles to the most recent version!)\n\nIf this list is a goal that Wikipedias are going to shoot for (especially the smaller Wikis) then there needs to be some versioning system or protection, so the goal doesn't keep changing. Is there some way we can say SOME VERSION IS THE LATEST VERSION with a lock against editing, and then we can work on a fresh version, so wikis can try to keep up with the latest \"wet paint\" version, or just try to stay with the stable version. Also it might be worthwhile to make a second list of 1000 (somewhat like the English expanded list) which shows the SECOND one thousand articles which should be done. That would be particularly helpful for us small Wikis that are just completing the first batch. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 12:42, 16 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n== Delete Verner Geisenberg ==\n\nI suggest deleting Verner Geisenberg, as nobody seems to know who he is. Furthermore, it has not been taken into account in [[List of Wikipedias by sample of articles]]. --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 01:20, 18 December 2007 (UTC)\n:I agree, and removed him. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 13:48, 18 December 2007 (UTC)\n::Maybe [[en:Werner Heisenberg]]? --[[User:Ecelan|Ecelan]] 22:51, 18 December 2007 (UTC)\n:::...Yes, that must be him \u00ac\u00ac' --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 23:34, 18 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n== trimming to 1000; now with more suggestions. ==\n\nOK, I just got done doing some of the trimming from the previous suggestion. How many more do we need to trim to get down to 1000? \n\nIf necessary, here's some more suggestions:\n* Why do we have [[:en:Rock and roll]] and [[:en:Hard rock]]. I think we should have the more general [[:en:Rock music]] which encompasses both. I'm waffly about [[:en:Electronic music]]. Should we open up this list to styles of music based on instrument types? If so, [[en:Orchestra]] seems like a better choice.\n* We have several examples of European Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Rubens, Bruegel, da Vinci, Donatello, D\u00fcrer, Raphael...  Can we trim it down to four or five? While we're there, I'd remove [[en:M. C. Escher]], even though I like his stuff. It's just not groundbreaking enough for this list.\n* There's overlap with [[:en:Sex]], [[:en:Sexual reproduction]], and [[:en:Sexual intercourse]]. I think we should keep the first, more basic article. While we're at it, we can probably remove [[:en:Penis]] and [[:en:Vagina]] (tee hee tee hee) but keep [[:en:Reproductive system]]. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 20:59, 20 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n:I agree with you; I would probably keep electronic music, though. Some countries could be removed as non imprescindible. Obviously, any people from these countries will feel it is absolutely necessary to include his country, but being a citizen from a country which doesn't appear on the list, and trying to make some balance between continents, I may suggest to '''delete''': China (keep People's Republic of China), Bangladesh, Poland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates... (why is Pakistan on bold?), and I would '''add''' Chile. There would be 40 countries then (now there are 46/47). I'm unsure about some (like United Arab Emirates, but note there is OPEP). Of course, this is just an opinion, but the whole selection of countries is doubtful: I can't understand, for example, why Algeria is on the list and not Morocco. The african part seems to have been chosen only to show famine and aids problems: apart from South Africa, there is Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania :'( --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 21:16, 24 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n*I have eliminated [[en:Jackson Pollock|Pollock, Jackson]]; and among the authors [[en:Samuel Beckett|Beckett, Samuel]], [[en:John Milton|Milton, John]], [[en:Edgar Allan Poe|Poe, Edgar Allan]] and [[en:William Butler Yeats|Yeats, William Butler]]. There were 10 english-speaking authors from a total of 49, that was over 20%, which I think was extermely biased. And this still leaves 6, more than enough, and maybe some space for authors in other languages. --[[User:Ecelan|Ecelan]] 20:01, 1 January 2008 (UTC)\n:20% is not \"extremely biased\". English speakers including ESL make up 15% of the world population. Also, is there that same percent of authors in poorer countries? [[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 07:39, 1 February 2008 (UTC)\n: The current biographies list is now at 242 entries. I suggest trimming it back to 200. That would take care of more than half the overflow. I also repeat my suggestion of moving the Biographies section in its entirety to the bottom of the list as it seems to be the section most susceptible to endless additions. Maybe it should also be done with the Geography section. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 14:32, 4 February 2008 (UTC)\n:: I would therefore like to suggest the following be removed:  Botticelli, Sandro | Bruegel, Pieter the Elder | Marx Brothers | Donatello  | Escher, Maurits Cornelis | Pei, I. M. | Raphael | Rubens, Peter Paul | Vermeer, Johannes | Daniel, Arnaut | Horace | Hugo, Victor | Nabokov, Vladimir | Ovid | Pushkin, Alexander | Rimbaud, Arthur | Berlioz, Hector | Bruckner, Anton | H\u00e4ndel, Georg Frideric | Hendrix, Jimi | Mahler, Gustav | Puccini, Giacomo | Schumann, Robert | Vivaldi, Antonio | von Humboldt, Alexander | Bell, Alexander Graham or Meucci, Antonio (or should we simply eliminate both and have an article on Telephone?...) | Fermi, Enrico | Fibonacci | Haeckel, Ernst | Pythagoras | Bruno, Giordano | Francis of Assisi, Saint | Paul of Tarsus (we already have Christianity) | Rousseau, Jean-Jacques | Ben-Gurion, David | De Gaulle, Charles | Merkel, Angela | Abraham | Moses | Jesus | Muhammad | Buddha (all five: we have articles on the respective religions - that should be enough). Anyway - I have refrained from suggesting women and non-westerners as the list is clearly biased (even with these 42 names removed) and that issue should be addressed. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 15:20, 4 February 2008 (UTC)\n::: And (food for thought) the artists section (as just an example) contains 11 (out of 22) European early modern painters. Only three of those 22 are not European (Frank Lloyd Wright, Frida Kahlo and L. M. Pei - all North-American). Only 21 of the 46 writers, playwrights and poets mentioned are not European... and so on. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 15:35, 4 February 2008 (UTC)\n:::: I also would like to suggest flattening the list, i.e. to have every section like the Biographies section and not nested like in Language and literature or Organisms. I think that would make it easier to track additions and also help in maintaining a broad focus.--[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 15:52, 4 February 2008 (UTC)\n:::I think these are good suggestions that Akigka is making. I also think Yekrats' suggestions are good and sensible. There's no need to have both Rock and roll and Hard rock but I would keep electronic music. Regarding the countries that Meldor suggest we delete I would keep The Netherlands (no, I'm not from there :)) but the rest I agree with. --[[Special:Contributions/140.180.2.62|140.180.2.62]] 19:40, 4 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Euro-centric ==\n\n[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Radical_cleanup_of_Volap\u00fck_Wikipedia This] page says \"If you want to know which Wikipedias are better and which are worse, article number is not what you should look at. Please use e.g. the List of Wikipedias by sample of articles, or then please come up with a new measure of quality and present it to others.\" pointing to [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias_by_sample_of_articles this] page where the Japanese wikipedia is rated very low. I wondered why and came here. This artice list is very very very euro-centric. I suggest you get input from non-European communities and create a base list of 10,000 with lists of 1000 necessarily ''specialized'' according to some viewpoint such as euro-centric or liberal arts or hard science or history. - [[Special:Contributions/4.250.138.182|4.250.138.182]] 23:53, 26 December 2007 (UTC)\n: It is Eurocentric. Could you please make some suggestions of some important topics outside of the Western world? We'll try to work them in. -- [[User:Yekrats|Yekrats]] 13:44, 27 December 2007 (UTC)\nApart from the selection of articles, japanese gets a low rating because it uses less characters. If you go to the [[Talk:List of Wikipedias by sample of articles|discussion page]], you'll see it is being discussed to multiply the number of characters by a coefficient, to make it even with the rest of languages. --[[User:Meldor|Meldor]] 19:05, 28 December 2007 (UTC)\n: I came to this talk page to make the same point as 4.250.138.182. The Eurocentrism is striking. That would be merely regrettable if it were just a list of suggestions; however, it says \"should have\", and the English Wikipedia article on Wikipedia contains that wording and links here -- and if people are saying that the quality of Wikipedias should be judged by this list (see above), that's a ''serious'' problem, and I think the appropriate thing to do would be to put an explicit disclaimer at the top of the page saying that that's ''not'' what this page is for and that the authors are aware of the Eurocentrism and encourage suggestions on non-European topics -- and preferably rename the page to something like \"suggestions for a common set of articles in all Wikipedias\". This problem is not going to be solved by asking individual people who point it out to please make some suggestions. [[User:Joriki|Joriki]] 22:05, 2 January 2008 (UTC)\n:::I support Joriki's idea. I am rechecking this list for [sw.wikipedia.com Swhili wikipedia] and it is awfully US-Eurocentric. Lots and lots of infos in some areas with little relevance to an African reader. Instead of going to a 10.000 - base - maybe some proportional shares for continents in social topics/arts ? Something like dividing up science - arts numerically and then the culturally related part proportionally? [[sw:user:kipala]] --[[Special:Contributions/78.48.136.233|78.48.136.233]] 21:36, 18 February 2008 (UTC)\n:::: Disclaimer and name change as suggested is probably a good idea. Setting up a quota system to counter the Eurocentrism of the list is (IMHO) a bad idea. I think it is much better to reach a consensus on removals/additions by discussion. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 13:10, 24 February 2008 (UTC)\n\n== wikimedia? ==\n\n[[Special:Contributions/67.80.30.201|67.80.30.201]] 17:53, 27 December 2007 (UTC)there is nothing on wikimedia(or wikipedia).huh\n\n== Wikiquote list ==\n\nIs there a similar list for articles that every Wikiquote project should have? --[[User:Steinninn|Steinn]][[User talk:Steinninn|inn]] 16:10, 29 December 2007 (UTC)\n: That's a very difficult list to construct, because the notability of quotes varies between languages far more than the notability of people.  Nobody would deny that [[w:William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth]] is notable enough in France and Germany to be worth an entry in the French or German Wikipedias, but how many of his quotes are worth putting in their Wikiquotes?  I bet that plenty of people would be horrified to find that their favourite quote in Turkish or Portuguese is scarcely known in the English-speaking world. --[[User:Poetlister|Poetlister]] 18:43, 1 January 2008 (UTC)", "bytes": 77608, "sha1": "82wpvmoakomj4dgvz8ty7ienjwzoo9f", "parent_id": 1691421, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "deleted": {"text": false, "comment": false, "user": false}}

Or, as one of the comments suggest [http://meta.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_articles_all_languages_should_have&diff=37871&oldid=37869 here], only a desginated editor is welcome? \n\nI can boldly bring my own bias, but still it seems a bit too difficult to be NPOV. I would suggest that the page declares that this is just a list to consider, or to start from, but people are free to modify as they see relative importance of things in their language-culture(s). I would also encourage people to make feedback and bring their own perspectives to improve the list. \n\nA guideline to create a good list would also be helpful.

Perhaps this can be a more meaningful variant of the german Aa-qualit\u00e4tsoffensive (if you don't know what I'm talking about, don't bother). One of our problems is: where should we put this list? On meta is a very good idea, of course but then we have another problem: How should we link to the simple articles already there, and how should we link to the ones yet to be written? We could simply link to all titles at simple, but then there would be no progress meter. I've done a test at [[:simple:User:Sverdrup/list_test]] to see how many articles of the list we have.\n\nThen there is another question: Should we pull attention to this project and push it? We have a large workforce at en-wikipedia, and if we invite them to write 1000 useful, simple-englished stubs, we can get the simple-part of the project done in a rush. \n\nYour comments? [[User:Sverdrup|&#9999; Sverdrup]] 13:38, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n:I don't think this is something urgent. But I would love to see simple revitalized in that way even gradually. And if the 1000 essentials are created, the project team could go on to expand to the next 1000, and another 1000 afterwards, etc..

Ecology is (the only) member of its category, as is Chemistry, so this would suggest not; OTOH frex Computer or Medicine would be missing then which I think they shouldn't. Also, working on Czech translation, I find I would appreciate much if entries had, besides the link to simple: if there is one, always a separete link to real en: article that would be directly accessible for translation etc. Couldn't somebody write a script to add them? It would also help discover mistakes: ([[w:Edmund Hillary]] had two L, and BTW I would remove him - he isn't much important for the development of mankind, IMO rather Eurocentric, [[w:Eva Per\u00f3n]] should have an accute accent etc. (I don't want to edit the list, I did so just now and it could be joint with working some more of my comments in).\n\nDoes anybody know the exact number now?\n\nI strongly support removal of entries for individual colours - really, what can you say, \"roses are red\"?\n\nWhat is the point of the Boat/Ship dichotomy? (See above: If I could just click, I wouldn't be asking now).\n\n--[[User:Maly ctenar|Maly ctenar]] 10:24, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\n\n== Help! ==\nThe impression the initiator of a new Wikipedia gets from this page is: \"We don't want you to start a new Wikipedia unless you play by our rules for the first one thousand articles. After that, you can write about what's actually important for your language and the area it's spoken.\" This might be slightly different from the intended message.\n\nI know the project is not finished yet, but the new Wikipediae are not going to wait for it to be finished. If you want to help, change the page to offer them help right now, even if it's currently somewhat incomplete and suffering from Western bias, and find a way to offer it to the current, and future, small wikipediae. The whole Wikipedia project improves by step-wise refinement; the same can hold for this Minipedia. [[User:Aliter|Aliter]] 19:43, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n:Many Wikipedia have imported this list and used as one of their start point to improve their contents. Some Wikipedias changed this list and removed the Anglo-centricism of this list. Even a Wikipedia with over 10,000 articles found many black pages on this list when they intrlduced this list into their projects. You find a good example of the usage of this list (and improvement) on Italian Wikipedia. --[[User:Aphaia|Aphaia]] 16:33, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\nRegarding the Anglo-centrism: If it is know to have been removed from copies of the list, why is it still in the original?\n\nRegarding the Italian Wikipedia: No, I wouldn't. I would just find Italian words there. It's this page that should demonstrate its use, not some specific Wikipedia. But even more, it should probably be the supporters of this project who bring it to the small Wikipediae, rather than having it sit here until someone runs accross it.\n:Because some Wikipedias are interested in developing this list locally and not synching with this original list. This list appeared in the early summer of 2004. It has been developed here and there. In my observation most of editors like to improve it locally (after copying into their own project) not to remove it from this list directly. If you want to see Italian version or Japanese version, please visit those project. Aphaia.\n\n(If a 10.000 wikipedia lacks a lot of the articles on this list, does that say something about the Wikipedia, or about the list?) [[User:Aliter|Aliter]] 02:52, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n:Perpahs about a particular Wikipedia. This list suggested a standard on-line encyclopedia should have so-and-so articles (someone oppose certain articles but the idea itself might be approved; there are certain core concepts necessary to build up an encyclopedia). Some new Wikipedias, like [[ast:|Asturian]], have utilized this list effectively. But older Wikipedia have grown according to interest of participants, not systhematially, so it is not strange a large Wikipedia lacks some entries of this list. Sometimes it reflects a cultural bias of contributors (a European language Wikipedia has large number of Europe-related topics but small on Asia related topics, vise versa) or just the characteristics of Wikipedians (for example, if no contributor is skilled on medicals or biology, it is hard to make a good article on Anatomy). --[[User:Aphaia|Aphaia]] 05:24, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\nYees, and yees, but ... that will only create seperate wish-lists, it will not help the other wikipedias. And where some Wikipedias might use it as a useful checklist, to be effective the project needs to offer a whole bunch of small articles from the start. Look, like this: [[Minipedia]], [[Talk:Minipedia]]. That's how I feel the effort should be directed.

While the program had started earlier, under Roosevelt, he had been in the dark until then, and made this pivotal decision, for better or worse, on his own.

Brussels is on it, so why not Amsterdam? It might even be better known among people oytside Western Europe than Brussels. The city of Amsterdam is bigger than the city of Brussels (though smaller than the ''state'' of Brussels). Jerusalem, being smaller as well, is also included. I will put it back now and I beg people not to remove it unless they have a very good reason to do so.--[[User:Caesarion|Caesarion]] 12:58, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n:I really thought that your edit was a joke or a test if anyone watches this article, because your edit summary sounded like that. More comments: Brussels is in the list because of its governmental (EU) importance. Jerusalem is in the list because it is an important city in the Abrahamic religions. Do you have any other reason for the inclusion than the size? If not, then we would also had to add e.g. Birmingham, Budapest and plenty of other cities because they are larger than Amsterdam. ([[en:Largest cities of the European Union by population]] and [[en:Largest urban areas of Western Europe]]) The list would grow too much and lose its value. \"Better known\" is a subjective reason. -[[User:Hapsiainen|Hapsiainen]] 15:51, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)\n:Agreed. I removed it again because I think you didn't show the reason.

The time spent on arguing whether Amsterdam should have been on the list, could have been used to actually write an article about Amsterdam.<br>I've now rewritten [[Minipedia]] as an actual project.

You have missed the point of this page. -[[User:Hapsiainen|Hapsiainen]] 22:41, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)\n::::The article can be read in more than one way, but the now archived top of this discussion page really discussed the place of the stub-like article to go with the list. But regardless, come write an article on Brussels: How long can it take you to write 500 characters or less on where it is, what it's the capital of, and what it is best known for. As soon as you do, any Wikipedia can use that as a starting point, even if they've never heard of Brussels. [[User:Aliter|Aliter]] 13:54, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n::Well, Hapsiainen, your arguments certainly do make sense. However, I had other reasons than size to include Amsterdam. First, ask a thousand Americans, Chinese, Japanese or Argentines or whatever non-Europeans if they know Amsterdam, Brussels, Budapest or Birmingham. I would be very surprised if Amsterdam did not do best of those four. Second, for a long time it had more significance than Brussels. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Brussels was important (and during the MA far more so than Amsterdam), but not more significant than competitors like Brugues, Liege and Antwerp, successively. Amsterdam, in the seventeenth century, did exceed its neighbours in size and significance by far, and was the third town in Europe (after London and Paris), and indeed one of the biggest seaports. Similarly, The Netherlands during this so called Golden Age were a powerful entity and a serious competitor for France and England. Please consider this, and then consider including Amsterdam again. This will do for now.--[[User:Caesarion|Caesarion]] 11:59, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n===...and some other cities===\nBut there are some more cities I miss. Maybe we should expand the list to some 50 elements. I do not think that would be too big an inflation for the towns that are already on it (and of all of which I agree they must be maintained. I think these cities, apart from Amsterdam, would be useful to be included:\n\nAlexandria, Baghdad, Buenos Aires, Casablanca, Delhi, Johannesburg, Kyoto, Lahore, Lima, Nairobi, Nanking, Prague, San Francisco and S\u00e3o Paulo. Many of these are more urgent than Amsterdam, as both Africa and South America are underrepresented with only one city.--[[User:Caesarion|Caesarion]] 17:46, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n:Disagreed on expansion to 50. There are almost 200 entries to each country already. That is one five of this list (this list will provide 1,000 basic entries to start points to build an encyclopedia). For this purpose 250 entries to cities and countries seem however too many: one fourth of the list: we have to list other things, like science related matters, historical events, and so on. On the other hand, it is a nice proposal this list has to have some cities additionally, but some of cities your listed couldn't be included in the reason the above, I think. --[[User:Aphaia|Aphaia]] | [[Translation requests/WQ/2/Ja:|<font color=lightseagreen>WQ2\u7ffb\u8a33\u4e2d</font>]] | [[User talk:Aphaia|talk]] 05:18, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n=== Minipedia cities ===\nOk, there are now two city pages in the Minipedia (though they could be improved): [[Minipedia:Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] and [[Minipedia:Brussels|Brussels]], and of these Amsterdam is [[Minipedia#List of pages by vote|ahead by one vote]].

I find it a bit sad that that will not happen as part of th\u00eds project, but there may prove to be advantages to such a two-track approach. Still, as the discussion here clearly shows the cultural(?) gaps are not easy to bridge, I hope everyone here will on occasion spend a few minutes on Wikimedia, if only to vote for what they consider an article all languages must have. But of course, Wikipedia functions best when articles are written, so I can only hope some also can spare five minutes to write or improve a stub article on a subject they feel is important. And to tie up the last loose end: The answer to Aphaila's question is on the [[Minpedia]] page. [[User:Aliter|Aliter]] 22:56, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)\n\nWhy should we have a minipedia when we can just create an index of articles in the simple English Wikipedia?

This would better prove that these articles are expected in most wikis, because it already exists in lots of cultures. So why not starting by getting interwiki statistics from English Wikipedia (with which most other wikis have made interwiki links, the other links being much longer to propagate between other wikis), and from a few other major wikis in the top-10 (to avoid the bias in favor of occidental culture, i.e. European languages written with the Latin script, where some important topics are well covered for example in most Asian wikis, but not very well in occidental ones).\n: So I would suggest checking the list of interwiki links with at least the major languages of each major script: English, German, French, Spanish and Portuguese (Latin-written), Chinese (Han-written), Russian (Cyrillic written), Arabic, Hindi (Devanagari-written), and create an effort so that these top lists are unified by resolving and completing interwikis between them. This should be a permanent maintenance effort to check that this list of top-interwikified articles synchonized in those wikis. In some cases, you will notice that a singlewiki has lots of interwikis to some regional languages, but not in other major wikis. The solution is to create at least the article stubs in the other major interwikis, to import the interwikis (the creation of stubs in other major wikis can't be automated, but a bot can still maintain a list of most-wanted articles in these wikis, and cite the other major wiki which has the greatest number of interwikis).\n: All interwikis found in major wikis should be counted (including interwikis to regional languages)\n: This list should be updated regularly (monthly?), because of ongoing efforts and evolution on all projects. There are already existing tools to help this maintenance task, notably the interwiki checker tool.\n: If the list becomes too large, another useful statistic can be used to help sorting it: onecancount the number of links with \"Special:whatlinkshere\" on the major wikis.\n: For now, the proposed list is clearly too much biased in favor of US-English culture, and there are lots of more important subjects to cover (for example, is it really needed to have \"Marylin Monroe\" in all wikis? I don't think so, this subject is really secondary for Arabic or Chinese users, and local culture really have their own \"stars\" that don't match the US profile.) [[:fr:Utilisateur:Verdy_p|Verdy_p]] 21:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)\n:: In my opinion the idea of choosing by (possibly weighted) number of interwiki links sounds like an ingenious way to generate a nonbiased list. --[[User:SLi|SLi]] 14:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)\n:: There's a nice and probably useful list at [[Common Interwiki links]]. --[[User:SLi|SLi]] 15:47, 7 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n==Necessity of \"women in history\" section==\nSpecial headings are unnecesary for oft-persecuted groups, let alone the single, arbitrary choice of women. The women in the category should remain on the list, but they should be filed under their respective categories. Separating the women implies that gender is more important than their accomplishments. The grouping also creates issues for figures like \"Rosa Parks,\" who, while a woman, mostly fought for racial minority rights. Why focus on her womanhood when she focused more on her African heritage? The women on the list who worked for women's rights should be grouped under \"human rights\" or a new \"women's rights\" category. [[User:Davidstrauss|Davidstrauss]] 21:56, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)\n*I'm going to move the people out of the \"Women in History\" section and into others if I don't see any counter-arguments soon. [[User:Davidstrauss|Davidstrauss]] 08:11, 10 May 2005 (UTC)\n**Well David, women were always a suppressed group, and those who have risen to any significance according to traditional (male based) standards at all are special. That is why this category exists and why it contains people that would probably ''not'' be listed if they had been male. [[User:Caesarion|Caesarion]] 19:32, 31 May 2005 (UTC)\n***I think we would be justified in listing every woman in that section using gender-neutral standards. Like I said, I don't seek to remove any of the women from the list, I just think the categorization is contrived and nonconducive to good interlinking of the articles. I'd rather see more categorization based on the fields of achievement than primarily \"Categories: Women in History.\" How we classify the articles here affects how they will be organized in target Wikipedias. --[[User:Davidstrauss|Davidstrauss]] 00:11, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)\n*I agree with David that special section for women is belittling. Sappho, Marie Curie, Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria, Cleopatra and Catherine the Great would definitely be listed, although they were in other sections. I don't know about all the listed women enough to say if they were important enough. Here is my idea of new addition: Harriet Taylor should be next to John Stuart Mill. She influenced his works a great deal, John Stuart Mill wrote that it is impossible to say which part of them is from her, which part from him. And Murasaki Shikibu must be there, because \"The Tale of Genji\" is allegedly the first novel in the world. -[[User:Hapsiainen|Hapsiainen]] 12:07, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)\n\nI agree with both sides here. Yep, it's possible. On the one hand, it's helpful to have a section that focuses on women *trailblazers*, those who may not have been able to change the entire world, but certainly made headway for their gender before more enlightened times, as Caesarian said. \n\nI.e. Elizabeth Blackwell did not find the cure for cancer, and therefore is not on the same level as Pasteur, for instance... but she was one of the first women to become an MD and practice medicine in the US; Mary Lyon likewise transformed education by opening Mount Holyoke college, arguably the first college for women. Yes, women outnumber men now in medical school, and in colleges and universities - but half a century ago (which is a blip in human history), women couldn't attend Princeton, Amherst, Dartmouth or enter the University of Michigan student union by the front door! \n\nBut the others are also right in that women who *have* made a significant impact, regardless of their gender, need to be normalized in the rest of the work - eg Marie Curie, Queen Elizabeth I, Jane Austen, etc. If I may further editorialize, these articles are going to be read by girls *and* boys. It irritated me to learn later in life that all the interesting women who had done work in science and the arts were often covered only in \"women's history\" work, or footnoted because their work covered \"feminine\" pursuits, eg Mary Cassatt painted women and kids, so her work wasn't \"serious\" - pfft - but imagine the young men who utilize this information, and get the wrong impression about what women have achieved and are capable of. Many young men aren't going to be dawdling around a \"women's history\" section, but will be more interested to read about a woman who studied and achieved in their own field. [[User:67.10.131.229|67.10.131.229]] 06:22, 13 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n----\nIsn't listing women separately an affront and offence to that which they strove to achieve? Wasn't the original problem that women were perceived as different, lesser and not able to compete with men on an equal footing that they were oppressed into segregation in all things? Wouldn't segregating women into their own separate list be a further discriminatory offence? Doesn't it give the impression that they are listed because of their sexual organs rather than because of their work? Won't this mean that when someone chooses to look up \"mathematicians\" or \"scientists\" they will find an entirely male only list because women have been moved into their own separately \"lesser category\" of not being quite as important for what they did, as their importance for being able to give birth to children? Is not the whole entire purpose, rationale and spirit of the equality they fought so hard to achieve, the very fact that special treatment - positive or negative - ceases to exist? That all great mathematicians are great mathematicians for their mathematical prowess (end of story), not \"he was great, despite being black\" or \"she achieved many things in a relative sense, considering she was just some lowly woman without a brain\"?\n\nSorry but I'm unable to find this to be a trivial issue. Because it seems to undo what they worked to achieve, it appears to restore the very injustice that some of them risked and sacrificed their lives to rectify, by calmly putting the women away in a separate little box where they can't do any harm. That the women are \"kept\" to one side, away from the serious stuff of the men. This is simply wrong on many levels. It saddens me to see that such prejudice still exists to still insist on keeping women out of \"men's affairs\". It perpetuates the injustice. These women were great. Not great because they were women. But great because they were human beings who achieved great things.\n\nPut the mathematicians in the mathematician category. No, I didn't say put the women mathematicians in the male mathematician's category. I said put all the mathematicians of whatever gender, skin colour, disability or whatever else in the mathematicians category because that what they were. Anything else is prejudice and prejudice was the very injustice many of these women wrongly suffered and fought against. You insult them by listing them separately, in my humble view. It mocks them. \n\nRegards the women who's achievements were specifically in the cause of women's rights then add them to a \"human rights\" category and list them there (alongside Rev.Martin Luthor King). Think about it. You're listing the women differently because you're listing them by what they are. For everyone else, they are being listed by what they achieved. That's not equal treatment. \n\nFurther, I'd point out that this is a major violation of NPOV too, from a practical point of view. Please can this be voluntarily corrected on agreement of principle. I'm sure it's unintentional but, as it stands, this separate list for women is a form of mockery of them. An insult to exactly that which they fought so hard against. It gives out entirely the wrong message. Men are listed as \"mathematician\" or \"physicist\". Women are listed as \"women\". Putting them to one side and keeping them away from the \"real\" stuff. It's just not on. Not on at all. [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 03:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n:In addition, there is a further practical problem. I've just noticed that at least ''Cleopatra'' exists twice in the list. This has been no doubt caused by this sexist double standard in the categorisation. Orwellian double-think. ''Cleopatra'' is added because she's a woman to the \"harmless little box away from reality we put women in\" mockery list. Then she's added elsewhere correctly for her historical importance. The duplication has been caused exactly because of what I was saying above that the rest of the list is by achievement but the women are listed by what they are. That's two modes of contradictory classification at the same time, which logically overlap, and it's hardly surprising that it has driven contributors to error, asking them to quite literally maintain a double-standard (as that is what the term ''double-standard'' directly refers to) in adding names to the list. I can see that this is meant with goodwill in order to avoid under-representation of women but this is too much of an over-compensation that's leading to error and comes across as belitting and mocking. Which I'm sure was the opposite of the original good but misguided intention for the \"special list\".

[[User:Meursault2004|Meursault2004]] 14:55, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)\n:You could add them (and other can remove them vice versa). As for Lee and Mahatir I think they are still influencial.

It is not. I note that no-one has complained of Adolf Hitler being on the list. But you could not have anyone more anti-semitic than the systematic murderer of 6 million Jews, who was intent on no less than complete genocide (and not only of Jews alone either). No-one mentions the listing of Adolf Hitler because it's understood that an article on Hitler is not an endorsement of anything he did. It is understood that the preservation of the Auschwitz concentration camp as a Holocaust museum is not an endorsement of the Holocaust. But, on the contrary, a means to ensure future generations are aware of what happened that no such thing ever transpires on this Earth ever again. A biography of Hitler can act as a warning to future generations because Hitler did play on people's fears and charm them with his euphamistic rhetoric to get himself voted into power to commit his evil crimes. Should another Hitler rise, pray otherwise, then education of the people about Hitler and the Holocaust is the means by which it never happens again. Because the people will learn to recognise the rhetoric and see through any charm or euphamism to what such people really are, denying them power or any means to carry out their genocides.\n:This list is a minimum list, not a maximum list. The appearance of an article (such as that on Adolf Hitler or George W. Bush or Osama bin Laden) does not represent any form of endorsement or celebration of the person. As always, every article should be NPOV. Those on persons that of neutral biography. That of concept, netural explanation. \n:This is further reason to normalise and eradicate the special \"women\" section because this is positive discrimination and might be partially responsible for the false perception that this is a list of celebration and endorsement, rather than a neutral list of neutral articles (based only on historical or cultural significance, be it good or bad). I understand that some cultures feel that the positive discrimination by segregation of women or blacks is some form of compensation for previous injustices against them. But this is not the place for that and it only introduces a confusing double-standard. Some articles are given a special section of \"positive celebration\" on the strength of what someone is / was, while every other article follows a different classification of neutral listing on the strength of what they did (in purely NPOV historical significance terms). This double standard is conspiring to ruin this list, introducing a confusion as to how our classification is being derived.

A Germanic language page, a romance language page, etc. Every page would still need EN and SIMPLE because they're sort of the foundations.

There are many different manufacturers of cola drinks (and in fact there are two types of cola drink -- the ubiquitous brown one and the less common red one which actually tastes of cola). But if we want to be more generic it would be better to call this article \"carbonated beverage\" or something similar.\n\n== Added literature section; changed another section to social scientists ==\n\nBefore, there was a section on \"writers and thinkers,\" heavy on the philosophers and social scientists, with a few dudes like Shakespeare and Alighieri thrown in. The social science of how and why we are, is a bit different than the literature and drama showing us who we are, so to speak.  I tried to come up with a list of people who are still influential today, or who led a great literary movement, but it's heavy on American and European writers. Since there might be some arguments, I want to first back up why I chose what I did:\n\n* Isaac Asimov (prolific, popularized science fiction and science for many readers; also, member of the seminal Futurians, a 20th century group of science fiction fans who went onto greatness in their fields)\n* Jane Austen (novels and romances, in the literary sense, differ in that novels are supposed to be realistic/true to life, romances are not; which is why Jules Verne and HG Wells were said to write \"scientific romances\" even though they weren't about necking lovers. Anyway - the gist - Austen changed the format of novels, she was one of the first to write about love, family and money;  and her work was not crap, unlike most of the novels circulating at that time in lending libraries.)\n*  Bertolt Brecht (broke the fourth wall; explicitly ideological)\n* Lord Byron (Romanticism) \n* F. Scott Fitzgerald (epitomizing the Lost Generation, post WWI)\n* Hildegard of Bingen (a polymath who was influential in both music, religious and secular writing)\n* Victor Hugo (Romanticism)\n* Edgar Allan Poe (furthering horror, gothic, short stories)\n* Jean-Paul Sartre (existentialism)\n* Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (creating the horror/science fiction genre)\n* Murasaki Shikibu (first novelist, as stated earlier) \n\n[[User:67.10.131.229|67.10.131.229]] 06:59, 13 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n'''Additional''' literary articles\n\nAgain, tried to come up with people who continue to be influential, who permanently changed literature in some way, or were vital to growth of their country's literary heritage... etc. Anticipating disgust (grin) with some of the seemingly fluffy choices ... more explanation ...\n\n* Arthur Conan Doyle - Sherlock Holmes was then, and is still one of the most popular literary creations of all time, an early mass media hero jumping to multiple mediums. Arguably, Edgar Rice Burroughs also belongs on the list for this reason (perhaps under popular culture) since Tarzan and his Mars books also popularized mass media heroes. \n* Emily Dickinson - influential, great poet\n* Alexandre Dumas - less influential as a writer per se, than for developing the \"roman feuilleton\" - serial novels. They were the then-contemporary equivalent of dime store novels, with audience-pleasing characters and plots. Without Dumas, maybe no Sherlock Holmes, comic books, soap operas - or Rocky movies.\n* Dashiell Hammett - with Poe and Doyle, key influence on the mystery genre - invented \"hard-boiled\" school, and with it much of noir and pulp fiction genre. \n* Langston Hughes - the greatest of the Harlem Renaissance, enormously influential in African-American circles\n* Sylvia Plath - a woman trailblazer, but also influential in creating the poet confessional school\n* JRR Tolkien - His work led to the mass popularization of fantasy\n* the brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen - the first for compiling fairy and folk tales; the second for turning these myths into a new literature explicitly for children.\n\n== Why so few?  why were some of these important women bios hidden? ==\n\nOkay, I've come in late here, but I'm surprised at what's been left out in several key areas. Musicians (which I added composers to) is very short (5 people?), there are three times as many computer scientists listed, there are no military leaders in bios (although Osama bin Laden gets to be listed as a terrorist), and many pivotal women have been edited out with formatting. \n\nBottom line - '''is the point really to limit everything to a set number of articles, even if it leaves out someone or some topic that's important?''' \n\nThe women in history (debated above) list is especially limited. With some of the omissions made with editing (the only section in which this is rampant - with 10 names hidden ... with none of the names appearing in other lists)... did someone omit the people because they were not convinced of their importance, or did not know who they were, and assumed that they were not important?\n\nIe. Amelia Earhart is on the list, although she is more famous now for her disappearance than her disputed gift for flying ... (Amy Johnson, Nancy Love, Jackie Cochran arguably did more for women in aviation AND were known as better pilots) but Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Helen Keller are now hidden?   Truth and Tubman were two of the most important people, period, in the American abolition movement and 19th century America, with Tubman the \"Moses\" of the Underground Railroad. I could understand omitting Truth because her fame was largely as a speaker; but Tubman's achievement is unique. Essential? yes, to American and African history. \n\nI note also that there are a dearth of Africans and African-Americans on the list, period. The point here is not to be \"politically correct,\" but to cover people who would be key to any encyclopedia of the world. A reader might find Stravinsky jarring to the ear, for instance, but there's no doubt that he had an incredible influence on modern music, and thus would appear as a major bio in any section on music. (Although he doesn't appear here in the list of five musicians...)\n\nMeanwhile, no one has ever come close to publicizing the experience and special needs of the disabled as Helen Keller - without benefit of sight or sound. It's extraordinary that someone would want to omit ''her.'' \n\nAlso hidden was Emma Goldman, an influential socialist; Germaine Greer has been eclipsed, while \"Feminine Mystique\" author Betty Friedan, as well as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, are not even listed ... but world leaders Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir stay on?\n\n[[User:67.10.131.229|67.10.131.229]] 08:51, 13 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n:Yes, the point is to limit it to a set number of articles. This is set as a ''minimum'' goal, not an exhaustive list. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]] 19:53, 23 July 2005 (UTC)\n:Helen Keller is an inspirational figure, certainly, but she's had little impact on the world otherwise. She was mostly active in ineffectively promoting socialism. She doesn't deserve special inclusion just because she was severely disabled. And, sorry, but Tubman's underground railroad work does not qualify as African history any more than my family's graphic arts work (which happened in America) counts as Hungarian or Russian history. African history is, by definition, what happens in Africa. Only the slave capturing or initial transport would qualify. Otherwise, you're using a double standard where African history follows former Africans but European history doesn't follow former Europeans. Finally, approaching the list from the perspective \"Are there enough women?\" is intellectually dishonest. We should be looking at facets of the human existence and deciding on who (or what) affected each area most, not forcefully including women so this list has its own affect. Affirmative action isn't NPOV. --[[User:Davidstrauss|Davidstrauss]] 18:08, 1 August 2005 (UTC)\n\n==minor languages==\nwhile it doesn't do any harm to any WP to have all these articles, I do think that especially for minor languages, it is much more important to concentrate on local of folkloristic issues that will not be on any other WP. On [[:als:]] for example (Alemannic; there are no speakers of Alemannic who do not also read and write German), I will not be motivated to write about Nelson Mandela or Leif Ericsson, since anybody can read about them on [[:de:]] or [[:en:]], while topics of regional Swiss or Swabian notability are much more likely not to be on one of the 'big' 'pedias. [[User:81.63.52.72|81.63.52.72]] 08:38, 19 July 2005 (UTC)\n:I don't see why we'd put such issues first into the minor language Wikipedias. If a concept is \"folkloristic\", it's already more likely known by the speakers of the minor-language Wikipedia. I don't really turn to Wikipedia to learn about my own culture. I use it to read about other cultures. --[[User:Davidstrauss|Davidstrauss]] 18:11, 1 August 2005 (UTC)\n::I agree totally with [[User:81.63.52.72|81.63.52.72]]. This list does not make much sense for many smaller languages, who have their own history and their own important figures, who perhaps have no other mention in the larger wikipedias. And not everyone who speaks a minority language already knows everything about their own history and culture, but they are more likely to want to read about it. [[User:Stettlerj|Stettlerj]] 18:59, 8 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n: In this respect I would like to add, that young and new members of a minority society today NOT know too much about their own culture, and that they are often quite eager to learn more. For this, a minority language Wikipedia is excellent.\n: Furthermore it might be considered, that such a Wikipedia may reveal facts, yet unknown by scientists, that are important for wider areas. So the remarks about [http://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wp/stq/Heedeb%C3%A4ie_%28Empetrum%29 plants] by Brokesales in the [http://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wp/stq Saterfrisian Test-Wikipedia] (see [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_new_languages#Sater_Frisian_Wikipedia request]) may be of importance for the etymology of plant-names. That etymology may learn about facts from dark periods of  history. And according to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santayana Santayana] (missing in the list!), knowledge of history may prevent us from being forced to repeat it! --[[User:Pyt|Pyt]] 15:51, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Inclusion of homosexuality ==\n\nIn [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_all_languages_should_have&diff=198402&oldid=197751 this] edit, an anon removed homosexuality from the list, saying:\n\n: definitely NOT something that \"ALL languages should have\"; in many countries it translates as \"perverts\" and is illegal to promote; whose agenda is to put this in \"all languages\"??\n\nAs I thought that this might be a rather... contraversial move, I've reverted and am now asking for input.\n\n[[User:Jdforrester|James F.]] [[User_talk:Jdforrester|(talk)]] 09:41, 26 August 2005 (UTC)\n\n: We well know the \"American way\" is to want to force the miserable perversion of homosexuality to be promoted in a positive light, on every other language and culture in the world, but I'm warning you now, this will be answered with the stiffest and most widespread resistance, if that is your ultimate eventual agenda, so just give it up.\n\n: [ Anon ]\n\n:: Reverted again. --[[User:Palnatoke|Palnatoke]] 06:34, 27 August 2005 (UTC)\n\nOK, you would not heed my warning.  You insist on having an official policy that says you're going to ram homosexuality down the throats of people who really don't want to hear anything about it, and in countries where doing so is illegal. It's exactly for stuff like this why you are rapidly getting a reputation as \"jokipedia\".\n\nIt's a shame really.  This site had so much potential.  But now it looks like it's going to be used as a tool for spreading unhealthy and immoral perversion to the innocent.  Now prepare for WAR.\n\n[ Anon ]\n\n: Wikipedia aims to present information from a [[neutral point of view]] without making moral judgments. We also include articles on many other things that many cultures find distasteful or immoral. If you find this unacceptable then I suggest Wikipedia is not for you; you are welcome to take the content you do find acceptable and make your own fork. [[User:Mindspillage|Mindspillage]] [[User talk:Mindspillage|(spill yours?)]] 07:33, 28 August 2005 (UTC)\n\nYou can not use the pretext of \"neutrality\" when you are trying to preach homosexuality in contravention of local law and decency. That pretext works in your country, but we are determined not to let our countries get like yours. Leave it up to the language and do not have pages dictating what they \"must\" have when the agenda is only to push homosuality as something \"normal\" and \"healthy\" which it is not.\n\n[ Anon ]\n\n: Now, hold on. This page is just a suggestion and in no way an obligation made to any project. This page is not dictating anything to anyone. Each community itself decides what is in its project. So, please keep cool and stop screaming.  [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] 08:46, 28 August 2005 (UTC)\n\nThat is reassuring.  But if I may have any input on this list at all then, for the record I am strongly against including \"homosexuality\" on any list of topics to be \"suggested\" (with \"suggested\" wordings no less) to every wiki in every language in existence, and will continue to resist such inclusion.  You have no idea what the conditions are in every population of speakers of every language in the world.  But what you consider appropriate for your condition in your country, will not match the conditions in another country that uses another official language, with a completely different mentality.  To suggest otherwise is nothing less than Cultural Imperialism.  To disguise such an Imperialist policy as \"neutrality\" displays the exact mentality of the gaudiest of dissipate Roman Emperors with their faces covered in make-up.  You may well live in a bubble, but others in the world has been studying your every move for 2000 years, and know well how quickly a \"suggestion\" can turn into something a little more forceful.   And by the way, the argument above \"without making moral judgements\" happens to be the argument of child molesters and pornographers.  They don't want anyone to make moral judgements either, and will readily try to use the concept of \"neutrality\" (their version of it) as a mechanism for doing away with moral judgements and substituting their own.\n\n[ Anon ]\n\n:What coutry do you come from, and what wiki do you work on?\n: [[User:Li-sung|Li-sung]] 17:08, 28 August 2005 (UTC)\n\nI'm not sure it would be prudent to reveal what wiki(s) at this juncture; you can just put me down as a native Hasmonean...\n\n[ Anon ]\n\n::Hasmonean? Then the inclusion of non-male homosexuality passes because the wording is for a man to lay down with another man. Which following the underlying logic of your pedantically literalistic interpretations excludes women and animals. This modifies the content of the article but doesn't yet justify its removal. [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 15:00, 25 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n: I've reverted, again.

But not every country in the world has done so, or is ready to do so.  If you ask every language to have an article on the subject, some of them are going to be a little more frank, and not as flattering, as others might like!  Those wikis represent cultures that would probably just as soon not have such an article in the first place, since the body of their knowledge, that they are trying to capture here, is not relevant to it.\n\nDid you realize that at no time in history have all cultures shared the same \"body of knowledge\"?  There have always been areas that one culture had better knowledge of, like medicine, etc.  This is true even today.  That's what makes wikipedia so important, and really, the next step of the internet.  Never before has such exchange and correlation of data as a group effort been feasible.  Especially for the \"smaller\" languages, such a tool can prove valuable in promoting diversity, and even in rejuvenating the vitality of the language by providing a databank for each language's speakers to take stock of its entire field.  In respecting diversity, we must respect that diverse cultures have diverse directions and methods and outlooks; we must not even dream of attempting to use lists like this one as a tool to enforce that \"everyone is on the same page\" as YOU happen to be on, especially with controversial agendas. Such attempts would only backfire, and would likely be viewed as a monster coming from afar through the lagoon to swallow one's city.

At this time, homosexuality was also illegal in Britain (this is no longer the case) and Turing was arrested for illegal homosexual practices. He was experimented upon (as it was deemed that homosexuality was a disease and they used living human beings as guinea pigs to try to find a means to \"cure\" their homosexuality), to the point where he committed suicide by biting into an apple laced with cyanide preferring death to their experimentations.\n\n:::This is historical fact. The history and eventual death of this man is bound up to his homosexuality. It is not possible to provide a proper biography of this man without referencing to the fact that he was a homosexual. Therefore, the question becomes should Alan Turing be edited out of certain wikipedias completely in order to censor his homosexuality?\n\n:::Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, Turing developed the foundational mathematical basis of computer science. In artificial intelligence, the basic test of whether to classify a machine as intelligent or not was defined by Turing and is therefore named after him, called \"the Turing Test\". In the very foundational theory of computers, there is something called \"Turing equivalence\" which defines whether a machine conforms to being a \"universal Turing machine\". Together with Church, there is also the \"Church-Turing theory\". Because he was so instrumental in developing the underlying mathematical theory of computers, it basically becomes impossible to discuss the subject without mentioning Turing.\n\n:::Therefore, the question becomes whether such censorship should cascade? If Turing is not included and not allowed to be mentioned for his homosexuality then a great many computer science articles must also be removed. If computer science articles are removed then on what basis can articles explaining what hardware and software is be written (when the definition rests heavily on Turing's shoulders)?\n\n:::If homosexuality is not allowed to exist then Turing can't be allowed and if he is not allowed then computer science disappears. This is only considering one homosexual man. There were many more and goodness knows what other large sections of wikipedia disappear, if they are edited out.\n\n:::Looking at it solely as a practical matter, the difficulty is that homosexuals might or might not be regarded as perverts by certain individuals and cultures. But they still have contributed to the body of human knowledge and achievement. If we cannot provide biographies of these people because these must include the facts of their homosexuality then how can any contributions they've made to the world be referenced? If you cut off the wrist then the whole hand is also cut off too.\n\n:::Further, in sections on nature, are we to edit out the fact that many species of animal besides humans are known to engage in homosexual activity? It is factual from observation that homosexuality occurs perfectly naturally across all sexually reproducing species. You might deem such observable evidence as pro-homosexuality that it should not be included. Therefore, you ask an encyclopedia to not just censor information but also change the facts from their reality to your chosen fantasy, simply to suit your moral preferences.\n\n:::In many countries and cultures, male homosexuality is illegal but no laws exist regards female homosexuality (infamously in British history, a past Queen disbelieved that lesbianism could even exist and, by this, female homosexuality was never illegal at any point, even when male homosexuality was made illegal). Therefore, we must ask the question of you: Could an article on homosexuality exist if it only makes reference to female homosexuality or to observations of natural homosexuality in animals? In every country and culture I know of, animals are deemed incapable of being charged with a crime. Their homosexuality is not guided by any known conscious endeavour and neither is it in any way illegal.\n\n:::You would also need to clarify the exact details of this policy. Is it the act of sodomy which is the perversion or sexual attraction to a person of the same sex? Because if it is the act of sodomy then must we also censor the anatomical fact that the female clitoris partially extends into the anal area that heterosexual sodomy would be a perversion for the same reason? Even if it is factual and completely naturally occurring, the factual truth must be altered and ommitted?\n\n:::The Ancient Greeks practised homosexuality as a bizarre form of contraception (a relationship with another man satisfying sexual urges but with no risk of pregnancy, as they would have with sex with their wives). It was considered in no means perversion or illegal in that ancient culture. It's not entirely known who did what to whom but names such as Pythagoras (his theorems are fundamental to geometry and the Western scale of music is based on his mathematics. Geometry is fundamental to topology. Topology is fundamental to chaos theory. Chaos theory is fundamental to weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. Geometry is fundamental to Einsteinian relativity. Relativity is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology. Edit this man out of history because he might have engaged in homosexual activity and you catapult human knowledge straight back to prehistory), Aristotle (which kills the scientific method and, therefore, all of science in its entirety), Socrates, Plato (no Atlantis mythology, his Republic never written), Archimedes (yet more mathematics, water displacement, engineering disappears), Euclid (nevermind, that's just killed mathematics completely) and so forth.\n\n:::Like it or not, people who've engaged in homosexual activity have contributed massively to the pool of human knowledge, science and technology (if not directly then by \"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\", as Newton called it, that one science depends on another, one technology on another that if you hack away the tree's root then the whole tree falls).\n\n:::From a practical point of view, whether the homosexuality is placed in a positive or negative light, it cannot be ignored and it cannot be edited out or altered to a truth that it not born out by the observable natural evidence without committing an act of intellect dishonesty. None of which abandons a NPOV at any point to make a single moral judgment on homosexuality itself. \n\n:::If you wish your policy to be accepted then it is only prudent that you supply the necessary exacting details of what is objectionable, what should be done specifically and what-not for policy review. So that the exact justification can be reviewed before we tell you to **** off. [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 14:42, 25 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n:::: Well you have committed several fallacies of logic here, and with all these false premises, naturally enough you have arrived at a false conclusion.  First of all, I have never in this conversation discussed \"editing out\" any existing articles.  I merely stated that certain language wikipedias may have better things to write about than the article \"homosexuality\", and by no means should they be coerced or pressured into having such an article.  It does not logically follow from that that there would necessarily be no references to famous homosexuals whatsoever on that wiki.  And that last paragraph is very arrogant of you, because it assumes that there is a body of pro-homosexual people in control here, who have authority over me, and that I have to attempt to justify myself to before they tell me to \"**** off\".  I recognise no such authority or hierarchy here, and if you do tell me to **** off, I likely won't.  Just so you know.  I have every bit as much right to stay here here as you do, Pete, and just because I recognise homosexuality to be deviant, does not give you the right to exclude me for my opinion that you happen to disagree with.  \n\n:::: Each wikipedia must be independent and set its own criteria internally as regards POV / NPOV, and not have it dictated to them by a tiny left wing group, if this project is to remain credible to most people.\n\n:::: Oh yeah, and as long as I'm still entitled to my opinion, I don't feel sorry for the guy who bit the apple one little bit. [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 15:53, 25 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n:::: The exclusion of an article on ''homosexuality'' is exactly a conscious means of editing the information provided. It would introduce non-netural systematic bias to the information, violating NPOV. For example, if I consciously made the decision to write about ''Darwinian evolution'' but then insisted I had better things to do than write about the corresponding ''Creationism'' from all the religions of the world then  that would be a case of systematic bias against ''Creationism''. Note that subjects such as ''genetic algorithms'' in ''artificial intelligence'' are based on an adaptation of ''evolutionary theory'' (the same mechanisms of ''evolutionary theory'' are re-applied to an artificial situation, in order to \"evolve\" practical answers to complex problems by emulating nature's method of doing so). Implicitly, the mechanisms succesfully exploited in ''genetic algorithms'' are an (artificial) evolution in microcosm and therefore you can't cover this subject without either writing of evolutionary theory in general and linking to that or, if it is deemed that ''evolution'' should be excluded for cultural reasons, that you end up writing about all the mechanisms of evolutionary theory inside the article on genetic algorithms (and it is left up to the reader to back-trace that if it factually works to useful purpose in this artificial situation then it's existence in nature, to one degree or another, must be guaranteed. Note, as an example that this is not necessarily contradictory and I'm remaining NPOV, the last Pope John Paul II gave recognition to the existence of the evolutionary process, whilst retaining his religion's Creationist beliefs). Further, we have subjects such as genetics, memetics, the Human Genome project and others which again are dependent at least historically on evolutionary theory.\n\n:::: If we allow this on homosexuality then you open the flood gates. Creationists can systematically bias evolutionary theory out of their wikipedias. Noting Rosa Park's sad death yesterday, racists could decide that they have better things to do and systematically bias blacks and the Civil Rights movement in America out of their wikipedia. Sexism could systematically bias all women out of the wikipedia (or place them in their own \"harmless\" section away from the men, creating a gender apartheid and double standard in the classification). \n\n:::: It exactly follows that if one article may be excluded by cultural belief then any and all ultimately could too. Logically, if the one is permitted then the others are justified by the same rationale. You say you have better things to do than include an article on homosexuality and this opens the flood gates that racists have better things to do than write about Rosa Park's death, sexists have better things to do than write about famous women, creationists have better things to do than write about evolution (or any of its dependents). This exactly logically follows. Unless you propose that only you are exempted with solely your beliefs while everyone else follows a different standard.\n\n:::: You talk of arrogance but what if a different contributor to your language's wikipedia wants to include the article? You arrogantly presume that a language's country of origin has cultural rights over that language's wikipedia. What if I was to learn your language? Would I not have the right both to speak your language and the right to my own beliefs, here in the country I now reside where homosexuality is not illegal, to contribute to your language's wikipedia? Culture and language is most certainly linked in linguistical terms but it does not follow that all speakers of your language come under the authority of your lands, your laws and your cultural beliefs. \n\n:::: The reverse example is the perfect example. You converse with me here in English.  This does not mean that you come under the laws and culture of England, does it? In fact, with the use of English as a Lingua Franca globally as well as being the main language of more populous countries such as America then most people speaking English here would, on average, not come under the laws, culture or otherwise of England. It's  not that clear cut that your language defines your culture and laws. \n\n:::: If you are stating that language defines cultural immutably then this list is written in English. The laws of England do not hold homosexuality illegal. It stays on the English list by your own reasoning but feel free to drop it during translation to your \"culture\". Though it is very arrogant to assume all those who speak your language share your lands and culture. If I were to speak your language then there is no cultural or legal impediment to my contributing an NPOV article on homosexuality to your wikipedia.\n\n:::: You also misunderstand my final humourous comment. I'm more than aware (as I've just tried to explain to you above) that wikipedia has no authority over its contributors whatsoever. Anyone may edit any page. If I learnt your language then I can contribute to your wikipedia and if you learnt mine then you could do the same in return. The wikipedias of all languages are not the possession of any culture or any religion or any land. There exists no authority here but reality (and the clauses of the GNU FDL). You misunderstand the nature of my comment that I was not suggesting you'd be overruled but I was suggesting that I believed you cannot factually prove your case for the exclusion of an NPOV article on homosexuality. My comment was conveying the pre-destined and pre-ordinained conclusion that your justification would prove to be lacking (which I base on my belief that you are simply wrong). I in no way meant that it wouldn't be fairly listened to (in fact, I exactly was encouraging you to compile your justification and present it. It is simply a personal belief that it would be lacking and your freedom of expression will be retained fully exactly because my beliefs do not override yours. But, by the same token, your beliefs do not override mine either). It is also merely a colloquialism to say \"**** off\", as I in no way meant to imply that you have no right to be here. On the contrary, I welcome you to stay and I am not of the politically correct mentality that I do not believe that you should be censored from expressing your opinion on any grounds. But I do believe personally that you are wrong. I presume you respect that I am just as entitled to that opinion and expressing it here as you are with your opinions, yes?\n\n:::: But, in the interests of reaching consensus instead of simply fighting, you are in agreement that homosexuality exists? It might be deviant and illegal to promote it in your culture and jurisdiction but you do not deny its existance. Is that assertion correct? Then write an article on homosexuality that reflects this. Write an article which states that homosexuality is deviant and which does not promote it but condemns it. It is a subject which exists. You have a passion to write here of its deviancy. Then write the article in that exact same spirit. Consider that even though it may be illegal and deviant that your culture and country does have deviants and criminals, yes? Homosexuality exists and maybe others in your culture are homosexuals. You could consider the article to be information to the homosexual in your culture about why their behaviour is deviant. Help them back on the right path. Try to maintain an NPOV within the context of your culture (so if the prohibition on homosexuality comes from a Holy Text then quote this Text to do as an encyclopedia should in providing such details of when laws were passed, who passed the law and so forth) but, yes, write the article within the context of your culture.\n\n:::: Is that a fair compromise? The article is not the promotion of homosexuality but its recognition as existing. You can look at it in the same light as writing an article about any other deviant behaviour. Murder is against the law but this does not mean that you cannot write an article about it. Would not an encyclopedia be the correct place for the law to be explained? How can people know and follow the law if it is not explained to them? If it is in the body of law then it must have been legally passed into law officially at some point. Write about the history of when this happened. That law must have an official definition of what does and doesn't constitute homosexual behaviour in the eyes of the law, so include that definition (if there are homosexuals in your culture then reading this article will tell them what they must or mustn't do to be keeping with the law, so you could consider it the upholding of the law).\n\n:::: Is that compromise acceptable to you? [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 01:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n::::: My friend, in 99.9% of the Earth's surface, homosexuality is likened to bestiality.  Just because it is something that YOU practice, or that YOUR culture glorifies, and you claim to be \"civilised\" and \"progressive\", does not mean we are not going to resist your forceful spread of it by any means possible.  The 1% of the earth's surface where it is considered a \"good\" thing are the places where you have forced yourself, not where you have been welcomed, and we have noticed this and are determined to stop it.  Why don't you insist that all wikipedias have an article on bestiality while you're at it???  Every sngle argument you have used or can use in defense of the one, you can similarly use for the other.  What?  Does that disgust you???  Well that is how people in most countries look at your culture.  We don't want any part of it, and we do not want to devote articles to bestiality any more than homosexuality, just because those things exist in places where they are tolerated.  If you are still capable of thought, think about it for a moment and you will see I am right.  There are different standards in different regions of the world, you cannot impose your own local standard which is the lowest common denominator, across the board on the rest of us that have higher standards, and all I am doing is fighting against and resisting such cultural imperialism.  I am not saying we should delete the English article on homosexuality, because that is obviously what English speaking countries glory and revel in.  I'm just saying put your missionary agenda aside and leave it alone at this point, because it's only going to backfire in your face more than it has already.  [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 01:32, 26 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n:::::: Rather than continuing fighting where neither of us are ever going to change our opinions, I've made a change to the list that it now lists \"sexuality\" rather than \"homosexuality\". This probably serves both of us better because, from my point of view, the failure to recognise heterosexuality and bisexuality (also, non-sexuality can exist as well as covering related issues of celebacy - religious and non-religious - plus even fetishism, swinging, threesomes, pornography. It's really a wider \"human issue\" than only homosexuality) would be as wrong as leaving out homosexuality. But, from your point of view, it's not promoting any particular sexuality (or, if you prefer to see it that way, \"deviancy\"). Content can then be entirely neutral, as no more than explanation of what constitutes what, remaining purely informational. Adapt as necessary for your culture and laws (I still don't agree philosphically but if it is against the law of your land then we can't ask you to break the law and must recognise that on a pragmatic level).\n:::::: Would this serve as an acceptable compromise? Sexuality as a general concept. So it would also rightly include other forms of sexuality without bias. From heterosexuality to bisexuality to non-sexuality (rarely mentioned but some people really ain't interested, irrespective of gender). Also a convenient place to mention celebacy (both religious - monks or other religious equivalent - and cultural - no sex before marriage - and conscious decision - movements promoting celebacy as contraception / disease prevention in teenagers) or even monogamy / polygamy or fetishism, if an article wants to go that far into the subject. Drop or alter those sections which might be breaking your laws (though I still disagree philosophically, you can't be asked to break the law for the sake of one Wikipedia article).\n:::::: As I say, the more I think on this topic then listing only \"homosexuality\" isn't really meeting my approval either but for alternate reasons. There's a massive subject here and only mentioning one sexual preference does seem biased. The more I think, the more examples come to mind. For example, in some cultures, Mormon and some Arab, then polygamy - having many wives - isn't a problem or against the law. Does that not also deserve a mention as gay marriages in the Netherlands (who, alternatively, allow that but do not allow polygamous marriage)?\n:::::: If we take a wider view then that satisfies me more as it covers the subject properly in a NPOV way. While it gives you scope to edit as is appropriate to your culture's laws, so as not to be breaking them. I still retain my philosophical stance on the issue but, in the end, it's a pragmatic compromise of some kind that suits everyone which we actually need here. We also can't ask you to break the law, which must be recognised on a pragmatic level. [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 07:30, 29 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n: Actually, what would really satisfy me is if you make it absolutely crystal clear, at the top of the entire list, with a message in very simple English, that this whole thing is just a list of ''suggestions'' (from one tiny group of likeminded people), and in NO WAY is it a requirement or official policy.  Also, the page should be moved ASAP from \"List of articles all languages ''should'' have\" - because the ambiguity of the English word ''should'' is proving misleading to many - to something more along the lines of \"List of 100 ''suggested'' starter topics for all languages\".  No one likes being told what they \"should\" do.  The whole idea of this page smacks of pure colonialism, and the idea that English speakers are smart enough to decide what the whole world needs to know about (like how many varieties of sexual deviance they can come up with, for example)... I'll bet if the list had been drawn up in Chinese or Hebrew or Turkish or Bushman, it would look somewat different.  [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 14:44, 29 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n::Minor point; you say \"the idea that English speakers are smart enough to decide what the whole world needs to know about\" above. Again, many people attribute language as equivalent to culture. It is not.\n::All of us here are speaking English because we need a medium through which to communicate with each other. English, for historical reasons (including, yes, past colonialism), has become the practical main Lingua Franca for international communication. Yes, not the sole one or the best one or anything else. This is just a practical fact for us to get this project done, it's not intended to be a judgement call or moral diktat or anything else of that nature.\n::This list is in English for the purposes of international distribution. A pragmatic reason only.\n::In other words, you can be an English speaker in any land, under any culture, with any set of beliefs and expert knowledge in any subject within the whole realm of human experience. \n::This list, if anything, is entirely to encourage that diversity, not cut it off. But some language needed to be used for communication purposes. English happens to be the pragmatic choice. Not the only choice or a better choice (Esparanto might be less biased but I bet most of us can't communicate in it and it could still be accused of Eurocentricism anyway), but a purely pragmatic choice.\n::If it helps, I come here from the Welsh Wicipedia. We're the first (and likely to also be the last) colony of the English empire. In the past, the English tried to delibrately destroy the Welsh language and culture. The Welsh language has been fighting for survival against the invasion of the English language for centuries. \n::From a cultural POV, I adopt the language of a colonial oppressor and past direct and active enemy of my culture and its language, solely to ensure that we might communicate with each other. It'd be nice to have that appreciated and that it's not assumed that there is a flat \"European culture\" with a singular \"conspiracy theory\" (a bizarre concept for what has the most diversity in the smallest area on the face of planet Earth, where nearly every country speaks its own separate language and where, as the EU shows, we rarely agree on even the most trivial of issues like units of measurement or whether we should or shouldn't have a constitution. Such suggestions, which I've also heard Americans express, frankly threatens being a paranoid delusion. The idea of a flat homogenous Western culture is a bit ridiculous too. Europe and America hardly come close to agreeing on everything either) or that it's automatically \"colonial\" or that you can claim to be the sole cultural \"victim\" that's ever existed.\n::Give and take. Showing understanding of others, even if tolerance or agreement can't be offered. That's how we make this work. And I do believe that this list can be fully made to work that all can agree on it and work together. That won't necessarily always be easy on contravertial issues but if we are willing, it is certainly possible. \n::Disagreement is not in itself a problem. It's natural, it's expected and it's the whole ethos of the Wikipedian editing process, in fact. But we have to be flexible in dealing with that disagreement or it all grinds to a halt and that would suit none of us, right? [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 11:14, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n==James Clerk Maxwell==\nThe creator of the unified electromagnetic theory and major contributor to thermodynamic theory should really be on this list.\n\n== Globality and the Global Village ==\n\nI don't know if ''globality'' is actually a real word. \n\nBut I feel this could make the best litmus paper test for which articles - especially regards cities and personalities - qualify. Then what this list comes to represent is a minimum set of core subjects of global significance that all wikipedias share because they are subjects that humanity and the world shares.\n\n''Jerusalem'' would pass the test because of its significance to the Abrahamic religions, which are global. ''Newton'' would pass the test because his work altered the scientific world and the perception humanity has had of its world globally since. I'd also say ''Rome'' would pass this test because through both the ''Roman Empire'' and later the ''Catholic Church'', it is a location of global significance. ''Mathematics'' is completely universal so it passes the test without any hesitation at all. We're all human so ''human anatomy'' should be included.\n\nThe idea being that qualification of articles is based on its global significance. That  it is an article which deserves to be in every wikipedia regardless of language because it is a subject that has no less significance in one wikipedia than it does in any other.\n\nThen this project could come to represent what could be considered a core of global subjects that are relevent to all of humanity, whatever language, whatever nationality, whatever religion. Which makes sense as a minimum list of articles to expect to be found in all wikipedias, irrespective of language. Those subjects to which everyone in the global village can relate to.\n\nNote that this test would be tough in places because ''Bill Gates'' almost seems to qualify more than ''Rev. Martin Luthor King'' or ''Gandhi'', in terms of only globality rather than notoriety or achievement. But I feel it both makes the most sense as the foundation for a set of core subjects that spans all languages by being those threads that bind us all together and also because it should involve less contraversy about which subjects to include and which to leave out. Subjects of global significance should be present in all wikipedias anyway. This list formalises that and makes a handy checklist for all contributors to ensure that the coverage on these basic global subjects is there.\n\nThe nature of this project seems implictly to be about binding our wikipedias and communities together that it seems to make sense to me that the subjects selected for the list share that exact same sentiment. [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 02:54, 25 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n\nAdding to this, it is indicative, that movie stars and makers are vastly overrepresented, and nearly exclusively represent Holliwood. The same can be said about authors - I haven\u00b4t seen one African, as if Chinua Achebe never wrote anything. I am a great fan of Aretha Franklin, but would she really make top 1000 in, say, the Hindi or Arabic Wikipedia?\nI do agree with Petrochemical Pete, that every contributor to this list should try to assume the pont of view of a Chinese, Paraguayan or Kenyan person interested in gaining knowledge about universally relevant topics. [[User:de:EMaraite|EMaraite]] 18:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC) from the German Wikipedia\n\n== Sports confusion ==\n\nUnder the sports section, there is ''football world cup'' as well as ''soccer''. I presume that ''football world cup'' refers to the global international soccer event here (as it would be ''the Superbowl'' for American football, yes? And the Superbowl is not listed because it's not an international event, even if a very big deal inside America itself?).\n\nIf so, then shouldn't American football be listed, when the other American-origin sports baseball and basketball are there (even if this always represents potential confusion that ''football'' refers to different sports - e.g. American football, soccer, Australian rules football, etc. - they should still be listed if deserving of an article, of course)? \n\nAnd without wanting to introduce any politics to this, ''soccer'' is understood but is not its natural name in most locations of the world, where it's ''football''. ''Soccer'' disambiguates, true, but it seems to threaten NPOV to not refer to it by its most neutral international name, which I believe would be ''football'' before ''soccer'' (though I may be wrong and would be happy to be put right on that. I'm not a sports fan and say this only with NPOV in mind, as I actually don't care personally which is used).\n\nAlso, ''gymnastics'' seems absent and wouldn't it be perhaps more universal to list ''martial arts'' rather than ''Judo'' specifically (or we risk an explosion of each martial art being listed individually e.g. Karate, Judo, Jujitsu, Kendo, etc.)? [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 05:27, 25 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Overlapping topics ==\n\nI have noticed that oil, gas and coal appear under both Science/resources and Technology/Electricity.  They both fit under these headings, since the topics overlap. However I think it is redundant to have a topic appearing twice, even if the topic heading implies different aspects which an article could cover.  After all, this is functioning as the first starter list, showing major arteries rather than every vein in the body! I wonder whether it would be useful to users of the list to have a cross-reference between different topics in brackets after the topic heading eg. \u2018Resources (see also Technology/Electricity/Depletable energy sources and fossil fuels)\u2019 and \u2018Depletable energy sources and fossil fuels (see also Science/Resources) \u2013 but see amendments to Technology topic below. Then if an article heading appears only on one list the cross-reference may encourage the inclusion of the different aspects related to the different topic headings in the one article, without repeating the article title itself. [[User:Lloffiwr|Lloffiwr]] 17:40, 30 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Amendments to technology ==\n\nI have introduced two new sub-headings for Technology: Food production and Harnessing energy. My rationale is:\nFood production is generally considered to be fundamental to human survival and development. This topic could potentially include the technology of agriculture, hunting, gathering, storage and cooking.  There should also eventually be a fair amount of overlap between this topic and the topics of ecology and food.\n\nHarnessing energy has always been a major technological goal. This topic includes much that was included in \u2018common technology\u2019 and \u2018electricity\u2019. I found it a little misleading to have energy resources as a sub-heading of electricity when in fact all of the energy sources mentioned can be used as energy sources without having to be converted into electricity eg. windmill-operated water pumps, combustion engines.\n\nBy the way, how close is the list to hitting one thousand articles? [[User:Lloffiwr|Lloffiwr]] 17:42, 30 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Criteria for inclusion - NPOV ==\n\nOK, I do agree it started as a project in US. I can also easily agree many of its contributors are US/UK/Commonwealth. However the list is way too much filled with Anglo-American people. I already suggested (sorry, forgot to register a user on meta) to replace Truman with Nuclear Bomb. Similarly people from the last 50-100-200 years should not be mandatory, let leave each Wiki-team to decide. Is G. W. Bush more important than French President Miteran, or founders of European Union less important than the founders of United States?\n\nOne can use something like \"Include at least five local rulers and five international heads of states, and describe them with 3 phrases\". -- [[User:Bggoldie|Bggoldie]] 13:23, 8 November 2005 (UTC)\n\n::But an important component of this project is also its capacity to increase interwiki links between individual Wikipedias. If each Wikipedia diverges from the list then we lose that interlingual linking and the whole purpose of standardising a set of \"core\" articles to be found in all Wikipedias.\n::Alternatively, I suggest that as we simultaneously have the problem of far too many cities and people on the list (the cities alone were taking up a fifth of the whole \"1000 articles\" limitation at one point) then we work to cut the list down to just those cities and people which arouse no cultural contraversy.\n::So, yes, is Bush really deserving in a wide historical and global context? Perhaps not and we should strike him from the list. Repeat with all cities and people in the list. Solving both our problems - too many articles about people and places, as well as articles whose inclusion is contravertial - at the same time.\n::To achieve this might take a lot of haggling and disagreement and editing, true. But isn't that somewhat the point of the Wikipedian editing process? Yes, the initial list was perhaps too American. Then it was edited but was still a bit too Western. Please, edit it further so that it loses that Western bias too.\n::No edit on Wikipedia is ever final. That's the whole point of this process.\n::On a purely intellectual level, it would be great if we could all work together and edit this over and over to edit each other's biases out of the list. What would an ultimate final unbiased list of NPOV articles look like? I'd love to know. \n::It's also a good Wikipedian selling point. No paper-based encyclopeadia (e.g Britannica) can come close to offering anything similar, as we're exploiting an internationalism they can't really duplicate. Why merely emulate paper-based encyclopeadias when we can potentially exceed them?\n::We will disagree. That is not a problem in itself and we shouldn't automatically divide and go our separate ways at the first sign of a disagreement. Let us divine out of the confusion what we can agree on. Let us edit it and alter it and change the wording or whatever is necessary to make it fit.\n::Our disagreement is what keeps us honest. We shouldn't be frightened of that but should be celebrating it. If I add Eurocentricism to the list then come here and tell me where I went wrong and we'll edit it back out of the list. We can work to keep each other honest and that step-by-step takes the biases out of the list one-by-one.\n::Please also can we not be divisive and suggest that \"Western culture\" is to blame. I've had to pick up on a discrimination point about women (which I believe had an American origin) and argued about sexual discrimination (with, if I understand the reference he made correctly, has Israeli origin). Westerners are equally picking up biases that other Westerners are introducing too. \n::We're all biased. We can't help that. But - how shall we put it? - Wikipedians by their nature of contributing to this project aren't necessarily representatives of the wilder internationally negative policies of their governments. Have I put that diplomatically enough for everyone? It's very likely many of us are here to learn about things we don't know (seems logically enough for an encyclopeadia, yes?), such as about other cultures, to help correct and rectify our ignorance. The whole point of knowledge and education is to correct the problem of ignorance in some way.\n::As one of my fellow countrymen, the founder of Britain's National Health Service, Aneurin Bevan, once said: \"This is my truth, tell me yours\". [[User:PetrochemicalPete|PetrochemicalPete]] 11:55, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Inclusion/Ranking Criteria==\n\nI would recommend that the determining factor on where things are ranked or whether they warrant inclusion be search frequencies, if such are available.  Words that are searched for the most frequently (and over multiple languages, if possible, to diffuse language bias), should be made highest priority for inclusion in new wikipedias.  Is it possible to obtain these statistics?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 19:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)\n\n::Nice idea. I'd resist making it solely based on searches alone because the fact that no-one has recently searched for differential calculus or Plato doesn't mean that the subjects aren't important or that they won't see a lot of searches made on them in the future. \n::For example, Iraq or George Bush might get a lot of searches at the moment because of contemporary events (people looking to better inform themselves over the issues in that day's news stories). \n::Being based on searches alone might bias things to contemporary events more than it should. This is an encyclopeadia rather than a news service, after all (though, yes, one of the advantages of Wikipedia is that it can update incredibly quickly to not necessarily be that distant to a news service but it isn't the prime purpose here).\n::But a list of searches could help prioritise and, on a purely practical level, search terms might show up topics that we never thought of. It might help expose holes and biases in the list. You never know.

Your kneejerk assumption that I'm just here to make push my agenda and my post here was merely a \"formality\", just because I made major edits (that happen to all be improvements) to the article, is, to put it mildly, premature. I started making my edits before anyone had responded on the talk page for three reasons: (1) because editing the article itself is the best way to get other editor's attention (a very valuable thing considering that this is not an especially active project page), which is why I directed interested editors to this Talk page in my edit summaries (yet you arbitrarily claimed I thought \"noone would object or notice\" anyway); (2) to give a clear demonstration of what a lot of the changes I have in mind will look like if implemented, knowing they can be reverted if necessary but that putting such a version up will give people a much better idea of the options available; and (3) because I've made ''equally'' [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_all_languages_should_have&diff=314388&oldid=311837 major edits] many times in the past to this very list, and never has anyone objected to ''a single one'', so I had no reason to assume there'd be a huge upswelling of bile at ''this'' particular edit.\n:So, there's just one key problem with your response: '''you haven't actually said anything that's actually wrong with any of the changes I made'''. Your sole objection thus far is that I didn't ''wait'' long enough before making the changes, which is a bureaucratic objection, not a content-related one. As such, I'd greatly appreciate it if, rather than shrilly denouncing me for not waiting a few months for the proper bureaucratic channels to allow me to quickly and easily show what page changes I have in mind, you actually ''explained'' why you think so many of the recent edits I made \"violate several agreed-upon compromises here\", and, much more importantly, why they're '''bad''' for this page. Wikis allow reverts; there's no need for such tedious, counterproductive formality, when simply boldly making the changes facilitates debate and discussion much better. I've now shown some of the edits I have in mind, and you've now said you have an objection to them, so we can begin: Let's ''discuss'' this, not lobby accusations at one another. What about [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_all_languages_should_have&diff=314388&oldid=311837 my changes] is detrimental or harmful, rather than productive and valuable? I'd love nothing more than some thought-out criticism. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 17:12, 27 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Okay, fair enough, and that was a very passionate response...  Sorry if I seemed too snippy at first...  Most (but not all) of your alterations were indeed improvements, but I would like to see at least a couple of other voices weigh in, particularly the big change here that I feel needs approval is the redirecting from simple to main en:...  \n\n::I realise a lot of the articles are missing from simple, but I've spent months trying to whip up the ones that are there into shape, so that editors of foreign languages can more easily use them for a template for quick translation to kick start their articles...  Yes I know the simple en wikipedia is far from perfect, and has been subjected to much criticism, but I can tell you the people I've met there who do contribute do take a lot of pride in their effort at what is sometimes a difficult task, much like walking a tightrope...  In the long run it may not matter, because I've noticed that most of the wikis that have adopted this list into their own languages as a starting point, have ended up with vastly different looking lists, sometimes linking to en, sometimes to simple, sometimes to a mixture of the two, but rest assured, they generally will make the 'list of articles all languages should have' look the way ''they'' think it ought to look, and not at all the way it looks here.  And I still don't think trying to force every culture and all languages to \"be on the same page\" is ever a good thing, so I'm actually '''glad''' that all the lists look different.  [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 22:26, 27 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::''\"Sorry if I seemed too snippy at first...\"'' - No problem. I understand the reaction. Everyone feels a degree of involuntary possessiveness and conservatism with regards to articles they've spent a lot of time working on.\n:::''\"but I would like to see at least a couple of other voices weigh in,\"'' - So would I. And I think the best way to get a ''lot'' of people's opinions on all these changes is to put them on the main page so users will realize something's happening and come to the Talk page to voice their opinion. If you prefer, we can wait until at least a few more supporters manifest on the Talk page before restoring my edits, but I just think it's faster in the long run to leave the heavily-revised up on the main page, even if we end up not using ''any'' of my changes in the end.\n:::''\"particularly the big change here that I feel needs approval is the redirecting from simple to main en:\"'' - Fair enough, but realize that that's the ''easiest'' change to revert of them all: a simple mass-replace (which any text editor can perform) of \"[[en:\" with \"[[simple:\" will instantly restore the original links&mdash;that's how I changed all the links ''to'' linking to the English Wikipedia, in fact. So, if the ''only'' change I made that you object to at this point is the \"[[simple:\" -> \"[[en:\" change, why not restore my previous edit, if only so I can continue working on other aspects of the list in the meantime (I've been continuing to work on my changes, reorganizations, copyediting, link-checking, etc. while waiting, and will gladly upload them as soon as it's OK).\n:::''\"I realise a lot of the articles are missing from simple,\"'' - That's an understatement. ''Most'' of the articles are missing from simple (whereas all but one or two of the articles on the entire list are on the English Wikipedia), and even the ones that are there are usually very small (often one or two sentences) and in mediocre or poor English. (This is not meant to be an insult, it is just an honest assessment of the vast majority of Simple English articles I've read, of which there are a few hundred.) Simple English may certainly ''someday'' be a viable source for concise, well-written articles on all the subjects listed in \"List of articles all languages should have\", but at this time, purely realistically and practically speaking, English Wikipedia is a much better utility to link to. It's in the same language, but it has many more articles, much more content in those articles (but the lead sections of most of those articles should serve the same \"summarizing\" purpose as Simple English articles, and should be equally clear and understandable), and a ''vastly'' larger body of editors to check that content and ensure that it is verifiable, NPOV, consistent, and well-written.\n:::''\"but I can tell you the people I've met there who do contribute do take a lot of pride in their effort at what is sometimes a difficult task, much like walking a tightrope...\"'' - I understand the difficulty, respect the editors for their dedication, and appreciate the effort they've put into creating and improving so many articles, but they ''do'' have the list at \"Simple English\" already, right? Why not use ''that'' one to link to Simple English's articles, and for this one, which is much more expanded and thus much more difficult to meet the requirements of with Simple English's (relatively) minimal resources, use English Wikipedia?\n:::''\"And I still don't think trying to force every culture and all languages to \"be on the same page\" is ever a good thing, so I'm actually '''glad''' that all the lists look different.\"'' - Sure. Though it does make the title of this page misleading, no? :) -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 23:10, 27 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Your other changes are not so innocent as they may seem; in particular, you have reintroduced \"homosexuality\" as an \"article all wikipedias should have\" when I have talked at length about the inappropriateness of requiring or even suggesting all wikipedias to include this topic.  I don't know if this is something else you are personally passionate about, but many cultures are just as passionate about not mentioning it at all.  If you will note, the compromise was finally reached by changing the link to read simply \"sexuality\" but by repeatedly going back to the old situation, you are reopening the same can of worms, and I will be forced to resist it again with full force.  DO NOT force your agenda on the rest of the world.  What you do in your country is your country's problem.  Thank you.  [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 03:17, 28 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::I fail to see how what you describe is in any way not \"innocent\"; are you insinuating that I am not acting in good faith? Why is \"homosexuality\" an unimportant or off-limits topic? I added both [[:en:homosexuality|homosexuality]] and [[:en:heterosexuality|heterosexuality]] to the list of topics, along with [[:en:asexual reproduction|asexual reproduction]], [[:en:sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]], [[:en:sex|sex]], [[:en:sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]], [[:en:male|male]], [[:en:female|female]], etc.&mdash;all vitally important topics that were missing from the list. Why do you object to \"homosexuality\", but not \"heterosexuality\" or any of the others I added? And I saw no valid arguments against including it in any of the above discussions; could you repeat or quote the argument you are referring to? Homosexuality is not an issue in just one country or other; it is a matter of worldwide importance, biologically (it's not like humans are the only ones to engage in homosexual behavior), socially, historically, ethically, and politically, and for both those who approve of it ''and'' those who oppose it. Censoring the inclusion of a homosexuality article on the list just because it's controversial is deeply biased and itself seems specifically targeted to promoting an agenda (by suppressing information on a highly noteworthy encyclopedic topic just because some find it distasteful): the fact that it's controversial makes it ''more'' noteworthy and important to include in any general-use encyclopedia, regardless of language&mdash;and as you said, this list is a ''guideline'', not absolute law, so any Wikipedia that prefers not to include such an article can do so! Not including an article on homosexuality would be like not including an article on \"[[en:evolution|evolution]]\" on this list just because it's controversial or offensive to certain people. That's not an \"agenda\", anymore than listing articles on [[:en:abortion|abortion]], [[:en:The Holocaust|The Holocaust]], or [[:en:God|God]] is \"promoting an agenda\"; any good encyclopedia article will include ''all'' noteworthy information on the relevant topic, both positive ''and'' negative. Plus \"sexuality\" is too vague a topic; most encyclopedias, including the English Wikipedia, don't even ''have'' an article on \"sexuality\"&mdash;you might be thinking of [[:en:sexual orientation|sexual orientation]] if you're looking for an umbrella-article for this topic, though I honestly don't see the need. Care to enlighten me -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 03:46, 28 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::\"Homosexuality is not an issue in just one country or other; it is a matter of worldwide importance, biologically\"\n\n::I would beg to differ with that assessment.  Your pov is showing here...  It is far, far from a matter of \"worldwide importance\"., and I object that it should be categorised as something \"biological\".   There should be nothing like this page drawn up to look all official, dictating that all languages must write an article about homosexuality.  Leave things like that optional for each wiki, and don't try to destroy them by forcing things down their throat they might not want to include, if you wish for the whole project to be taken seriously.  [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 04:00, 28 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Also, you speak about \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality\" like they are somehow on an equal par or something... but this must be all in your own mind, or pov...  Not so at all... \"Heterosexuality\" has never been widely viewed as a deviancy around the world. [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 04:28, 28 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::''\"I would beg to differ with that assessment.\"'' - Then supply evidence and reasoning that demonstrates that homosexuality is ''not'' an international issue, and ''not'' a biological issue. I am not so unreasonable that I am unwilling to be convinced on this, or any other, issue, provided that you support it with something more than your personal opinion. I can certainly support everything ''I'' said, if you dispute a word of it.\n:::''\"Your pov is showing here...\"'' - An incorrect statement, and one that, ironically, applies to you instead of myself. I have not expressed anything regarding my own POVs on the matter; indeed, I have no strong leanings one way or the other on this issue, though there are certainly other, unrelated issues regarding which I hold a bias. All I have said is that homosexuality is a noteworthy topic, which it is; I don't have to have an \"agenda\" to hold that homosexuality is an important topic for an encyclopedia anymore than I have to be a Nazi or Zionist to hold that \"The Holocaust\" is important, or a pregnant woman or religious fundamentalist to hold that \"abortion\" is important, or a soldier or pacifist to hold that \"war\" is important, or a mathematician to hold that \"mathematics\" is important; all of these are just as clearly significant and necessary as \"homosexuality\", and bias one way or the other has nothing to do with it. Your own POV, on the other hand, is '''very''' clearly being shown by the fact that you are explicitly justifying the exclusion of a \"homosexuality\" article from the list on the grounds that you believe, based on your own personal biases, that it is a \"deviancy\" (even though plenty of other \"deviancies\" are already included on the list!), and that if a certain culture has no tolerance for homosexuality, we cannot ''suggest'' (you repeatedly argue that including that article on this list would be \"shoving it down their throats\", when we had ''mere lines above'' already ''very clearly'' demonstrated that the entirety of this list is ''suggestions'' and ''ideas'', not ''requirements''!) that an article be written to cover the topic. Although I have until this point at least found your POVs reasonable, even where I disagreed with them, on this issue I'm afraid that your bigotry has completely clouded your better judgment. There is ''no'' consensus to ban \"homosexuality\" from this list, and no possible reasonable justification for such a ban. Wikipedia is an ''encyclopedia'', which means that it deals solely in information&mdash;it is ''not'' a tool for trying to force one's morality upon others by restricting articles to \"clean\", \"safe\", or \"uncontroversial\" topics, which is excactly what you are (very inconsistently) trying to do here by banning homosexuality not on the basis that it's not important (which is the ''only'' requirement for inclusion on the list!), but on the basis that it's ''evil'' or that certain cultures believe it to be. On those grounds, if Nazi Germany was still in power it would be unacceptable of us to list \"Judaism\" on the main page, because that would be offensive to people who consider Jews immoral or deviants; that level of cultural relativism isn't so much tolerant of others' views as it is oppressive and intolerant, to the point of ''censorship''. You'll need a damned good argument and a hell of a strong consensus to violate common sense and every Wikipedia's standards so drastically.\n:::''\"and I object that it should be categorised as something \"biological\".\"'' - If you think homosexuality is important because of its social and political implications (which is certainly a strong aspect of its significance in today's world), then add it to the \"Human/Social issues\" section instead of the \"Sex\" one; excluding it altogether, however, is clearly unacceptable and an endorsement by Wikipedia of bigotry. I truly don't see any basis for your claim that homosexuality isn't biological, however (even if it's not ''only'' biological, by the definition you happen to be using), and even if it was, that wouldn't make it any less noteworthy or relevant to the list&mdash;that's just another aspect of the \"controversy\" that any source of neutral and verifiable information, like Wikipedia, must not ignore.\n:::''\"dictating that all languages must write an article about homosexuality.\"'' - Nothing on this list ''dictates'' anything, or says anything about what languages ''must'' do. You are constructing a very flimsy strawman, conveniently ignoring the conversation on this exact topic that we'd had mere minutes before. ''Nothing'' on this list is an absolute requirement, so why are you suddenly forgeting that obvious fact? Either you've somehow forgotten that fact or you're just being blatantly deceitful with your rhetoric at this point; either way, it's time to stop.\n:::''\"Leave things like that optional for each wiki,\"'' - It's already optional. ''Everything'' on this list is optional.\n:::''\"and don't try to destroy them\"'' - You'll have to back up this outrageous accusation if it's to be interpreted as anything other than a personal attack (and more unsupported rhetoric). That, or apologize.\n:::''\"if you wish for the whole project to be taken seriously.\"'' - Listing \"homosexuality\" on a very lengthy page of all highly noteworthy topics for an encyclopedia to cover will make the project not \"be taken seriously\"? That's funny. In reality, the exact opposite is the truth. You're making a mockery of the list by trying to force ''your'' POV down the throats of the entire Wikipedia project: because you personally find homosexuality immoral, you find it unacceptable to ''write'' about this topic, even though there's just about unanimous agreement among Wikipedia's editors that it's highly noteworthy! This project is not just a way for you to try to push an agenda on others, as you should surely be aware of by now; if you want to argue that homosexuality (or ''anything else'', for that matter!) isn't globally noteworthy or encyclopedic because of its ''morality'', start a new Wikimedia or Wikipedia proposal to that effect, and I'll gladly discuss this there. (Though it will surely be shot down, just like every other attempt in the past to institute a moral code on Wikipedia projects, every single one of which has failed in the past.) Don't try to sneak this subtle homophobia into a totally unrelated page simply because it's what you believe; that's just dishonest and manipulative. Sorry to have to say it, but it's the truth: only one of us is trying to use this page to force a POV on Wikipedia regarding the \"homosexuality\" topic, and that person is you.\n:::''\"Also, you speak about \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality\" like they are somehow on an equal par or something\"'' - They are&mdash;on Wikipedia, even if nothing else. For Wikipedia's purposes, they are no more or less equal than \"right\" or \"left\", \"black\" or \"white\"; they are two aspects of a sexual dichotomy, and nothing more or less. Whether one is \"good\" or the other is \"bad\" is not for Wikipedia to decide; that's just one of many subjects which articles on those two sexual orientations can cover, along with health risks, history, terminology, political and religious controversy, etc. \"Evil\" topics and \"good\" ones are covered exactly equally on Wikipedia; it is ''never'' justifiable to attempt to restrict coverage on a noteworthy topic based solely on whether the subject of that topic is good or bad. I challenge you to present any policy on a Wikipedia of ''any'' language that forbids writing about homosexuality; until you can do so, you have absolutely no right to try to interject your anti-homosexual POV onto this general-usage page, no matter ''how'' strong your convictions on this matter are. Save it for your user page. This project is a list of ''important'' topics, not a list of ''socially acceptable/ethical/uncontroversial'' topics. In fact, in many cases, the more controversial or \"immoral\" something is, the more significant and noteworthy it is, making it ''more'' likely to appear on this page than something that almost nobody has any strong opinions about (like the ethics of cottage cheese). \n:::By the way, this addition is infinitely less controversial and unusual than Blockinbox seems so strongly to think it is. There are ''already'' homosexuality articles (many of them quite detailed and lengthy) on every single one of the most widely-used Wikipedias in existence; out of the 25 Wikipedias that have the largest number of articles, only a ''single one'' (one of the lower ones, #19) lacks an article on homosexuality (or just hasn't bothered to put interwiki tags on the page in question). In fact, the ''only'' thing that seems to determine whether or not homosexuality is covered in a certain language's Wikipedia, that I can ascertain, is how many articles that Wikipedia has&mdash;the fewer articles a Wikipedia has, the less likely it is to have an article on homosexuality (and the less likely it is to have an article on ''any'' other specific topic, quite naturally!), which is quite understandable: the fewer articles and editors a Wikipedia has, the less likely it is that they've gotten around to creating pages for specific sexual orientations, or for hundreds and hundreds of other items that are on the \"List of articles all languages should have\". Homosexuality gets much better use on foreign-language Wikipedias than ''most'' of the things on the \"List of articles all languages should have\", though!! I can provide you with a complete list (in order of number of total articles) of which Wikipedias do and don't have articles on homosexuality, if you'd like; I wrote one up while researching to see if any of your claims have a basis in fact (as far as I've been able to ascertain, they don't), and can easily share it if you think it would be valuable for discerning a bias or variance in coverage.\n:::Until you can back up some of your claims, however, I'm afraid that it's simply unacceptable to leave your version of the page on \"List of articles all languages should have\"; you are the one on whom the burden of proof will lie to demonstrate that homosexuality is considered unacceptable to write about on a significant number of the foreign-language Wikipedias, since you are the only one making such a dramatic and bold statement. Just because my version of the page is ''newer'' doesn't make it more controversial&mdash;the view that homosexuality is a \"deviancy\", despite being a common view, is infinitely more controversial than the view that homosexuality is ''a significant issue'' (which is all this page is concerned with), which the vast majority of people on ''both'' sides of this controversy can agree on, if nothing else. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 04:06, 29 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I'm sorry but you continue to say that homosexuality is of major significance to every culture in the world.  I say it is not.  you speak like you have some kind of authority on the subject, saying that for wikipedia purposes, homosexuality is equal to heterosexuality like right and left. How did you get to make up this rule for wikipedia? That is something for each individual wikipedia to decide independently by consensus among the speakers of that language, and many are going to object strongly to the notion of some unseen, central bureau in unknowmn location, dictating that it \"must\" write about distasteful topics that it does not deem necessary.  The software should not be used as a vehicle for what you are trying to push. I am not required to prove anything to you. In many countries it is illegal to promote homosexual behaviour, that is a fact you can easily find out, the subject is similar to bestiality and if you want to write about it in your language do so.  Do not force your sicknesses on every people ND in the world, I will continue to expose and resist your sick scheme tooth and nail by any means possible for me, if this is what you have set in your mind that your purpose is to recruit deviant and sick, sinful and backward  behaviours to all the peoples and languages of the world. [[User:Blockinblox|Blockinblox]] 16:33, 29 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::''\"you continue to say that homosexuality is of major significance to every culture in the world.\"'' - That's a misunderstanding and distortion at best. I never said that homosexuality is significant purely on a ''cultural'' level; it's more important on a social, religious, and political level (though certainly there is a cultural aspect to it). More importantly, you seem to hold the deeply mistaken view that different ''language'' Wikipedias are supposed to be biased towards different ''cultures''. This is not the case: the only reason different Wikipedias exist at all is because not everyone speaks any one language, and thus information must be translated into a variety of languages to reach a wider audience. If it was possible (and it's obviously not), there would be ''no'' difference between any of the foreign-language Wikipedias; every Wikipedia, regardless of language, would have the exact same content, just written in a different tongue. Since that is not possible, obviously cultural bias will affect every Wikipedia, but our objective is not to go out of a way to succumb to our respective biases and let them fester while ignoring all contrary views, but rather to ''explain'' each culture's view within encyclopedia articles. That's what the NPOV policy is for. The Swedish Wikipedia, the Arabic Wikipedia, the English Wikipedia, and every other language's Wikipedia should all be trying equally hard to counter their respective cultural biases with outside perspectives. ''Every'' language of Wikipedia should, ideally, at some point deal with ''every'' significant perspective, including ones from outside the culture of the speakers of that language. This is the only way to avoid systemic bias and to make Wikipedia an encyclopedia of human knowledge and information, not a moral code or tool for censorship. If there is controversy over whether homosexuality is a sin or not, it is every Wikipedia's job to report on that controversy, not to ''participate'' in it and try to endorse one view or the other by suppressing or forbidding an article on the issue, ''regardless'' of the majority view on homosexuality within a certain country (and Wikipedia's are divided on a linguistic, not nationalistic, basis anyway). That's what encyclopedias, and reference tools in general, in ''every'' culture, do: they provide well-referenced, unbiased information (or as close to it as possible) on all subjects, controversial and uncontroversial, and try to ''minimize'', not exacerbate, their natural biases. Obviously it's not always easy to overcome cultural bias, but that's an ongoing struggle on every Wikipedia&mdash;cultural bias is not something that should be ''encouraged'', as that only leads to the suppression of highly noteworthy and commonplace alternative views, which would transform Wikipedia from an encyclopedic resource into nothing but a tool for propaganda. All of this applies to the English Wikipedia just as much as the others, of course.\n::''\"I say it is not.\"'' - You've already established that. The difference is, I have (and can, if you ask me to back up any of my statements) supported all of my statements with reasoning and evidence, whereas all ''you've'' done are repeatedly state your POV, without any justification or support, and expected that to hold sway. I'm getting rather bored of this discussion's one-sidedness.\n::''\"you speak like you have some kind of authority on the subject\"'' - No, I don't. I speak like someone who's ''familiar'' with the subject, and can thus explain it to you, since you obviously deeply misunderstand Wikipedia policy on this issue.\n::''\"saying that for wikipedia purposes, homosexuality is equal to heterosexuality like right and left.\"'' - It is. For Wikipedia purposes, no article's subject is good or evil; no article on Wikipedia should ever state \"X is wrong\" or \"Y is immoral\" or \"Z is good\"; it should only provide, with proper sourcing, ''claims'' and ''statements'' of such things, and who has claimed and stated them. Wikipedia itself does not have an opinion about any political issue; it merely reports on the controversy, without weighing in on it. Ergo, Wikipedia has no more favoritism for \"heterosexuality\" over \"homosexuality\" than it does for \"right-handed\" over \"left-handed\", even though most humans are heterosexual and most are right-handed, and even though historically many cultures have discriminated against both homosexual people and left-handed people. Even if homosexuality ''is'' immoral (which is unlikely, but not impossible&mdash;very little is genuinely impossible), it is not Wikipedia's place to say so (nor is it Wikipedia's place to act like this noteworthy issue does not exist by not even ''writing'' about it in an article), only to report on noteworthy sources that have said so.\n::''\"How did you get to make up this rule for wikipedia?\"'' - I didn't. I just have a passing familiarity with the rules, standards, and principles that ''already'' exist on Wikipedia, and indeed exist in ''all'' general-use encyclopedic references. You would do well to review Wikipedia's official policies, including [[:en:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]], and to become acquainted with Wikipedia's numerous and ongoing attempts to [[:en:Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias|combat systemic cultural bias]]. If anything, ''you're'' the one who needs to provide a policy supporting your claims that it's acceptable to ban \"homosexuality\" from this list, since you're the one making the new claim to this effect. If a policy supporting your view does not currently exist, you will have to propose one and seek to get it passed; until one is created permitting your censorship of homosexuality-related topics, you cannot implement your personal beliefs on this unrelated page.\n::''\"That is something for each individual wikipedia to decide independently by consensus among the speakers of that language, and many are going to object strongly to the notion of some unseen, central bureau in unknowmn location, dictating that it \"must\" write about distasteful topics that it does not deem necessary.\"'' - Nope, but more will object to some arbitrary, deeply biased individual randomly deciding that \"homosexuality\" isn't an important topic just because he finds it distasteful. You are not God; you cannot dictate what topics are or are not \"distasteful\". That is to be left to the individual articles to decide; the only purpose of this list is to provide a listing of highly noteworthy and significant topics, not to judge whether some of those topics are or aren't culturally acceptable. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not an arbiter of morality, and you are profoundly overstepping your bounds to judge that \"homosexuality\" is an unacceptably offensive topic, and ''nothing else'' on the list is&mdash;to censor certain topics on this list is not only problematic because it leads to biased and uneven coverage of noteworthy information, but also because it implicitly suggests that Wikipedia ''approves of every other article listed''! In other words, your actions are making it seem that Wikipedia approves of genocide, rape, and slavery, but disapproves of homosexuality. Clearly this is ''not'' an acceptable state of affairs. If you want to create a list of \"uncontroversial\" articles, that's a completely different matter, and you should make a separate page for that. You should not try to infect ''this'' list with your personal biases, especially when they're biases ''against'' certain topics rather than ''for'' them (the latter being much less harmful and destructive in the long run).\n::Incidentally, you continue to repeatedly claim that a number of foreign-language Wikipedias are going to object to including any information whatsoever on \"homosexuality\", but you have ''utterly failed'' to provide any support whatsoever for this claim. In reality there's no Wikipedia in existence that has expressed any problem with having an article on \"homosexuality\"&mdash;if there is one, on any language, please feel free to share it with us. Until then, your claims are entirely baseless, and just reflect your own strongly-felt POVs on the matter: because ''you'' consider homosexuality a \"deviancy\" and \"distasteful\", you think everyone ''else'' should, even on a neutral and academic resource like Wikipedia. This is fundamentally unacceptable and bigoted. Wikipedia does not judge morality: it reports on information. Silence can speak louder than words, and ''excluding'' noteworthy topics entirely because a certain editor disapproves of them is even worse than ''including'' ones that aren't quite noteworthy enough.\n::''\"The software should not be used as a vehicle for what you are trying to push.\"'' - And what am I trying to push? You have repeatedly insinuated that just because I disagree with you about what topics are noteworthy enough to include on the list, and that just because I don't believe this list should be used to try to judge which topics are \"moral\" and which are \"immoral\", I am somehow trying to advance an \"agenda\" or am just following my own \"POV\" or am trying to \"push\" my views down people's throats; all of these are very clearly false claims, and you still owe me a number of apologies for making such unsupported personal attacks and accusations, veiled though some of them may be. I am here to improve the list's usefulness to editors, not to push any POV. The problem here is that '''you''' are more concerned with pushing ''your'' POV than with what's in the best interests of Wikipedia and this list, and you assume that just because I am not willing to let you use this list as a vehicle for your homophobia, I am \"trying to push\" a belief on others. The opposite is the case; I'm ''removing'' another user's bias, not adding my own. Trust me, if I was going to add articles to this list based on my own personal interests and POV, I'd be adding very different entries than the ones I currently am; I'm honestly not remotely interested in this silly controversy. :) I'm just not so blind that I'm incapable of realizing that the issue ''exists'' and is noteworthy.\n::''\"I am not required to prove anything to you.\"'' - Of course you are, if you want any of your claims to be evaluated based on their truth-value reasonability, rather than purely on their rhetorical tactics. If you fail to provide any support for your claims, beliefs, biases and accusations, they are only words, and we cannot assume that they are correct just because you believe in them strongly. I've provided plenty of support for ''my'' reasoning (and will gladly provide more if you dispute anything at all I've said); why are you so unwiling (unable?) to do the same?\n::''\"In many countries it is illegal to promote homosexual behaviour,\"'' - How is that relevant? That's just ''another'' important fact that every comprehensive Wikipedia should include in their \"homosexuality\" articles. On Wikipedia, articles do not exist to ''promote'' or ''support'' the thing that is being written about; they only exist to provide neutral, factual, cited information on that thing.\n::''\"that is a fact you can easily find out,\"'' - It's a fact I already knew, and is one of the many reasons I added \"homosexuality\" to the list. The fact that a topic is unpleasant or controversial does not make it less noteworthy, and noteworthiness and significance are the only things that determine what is included on this list. If it wasn't, we wouldn't have [[Adolf Hitler]] included on the list either, but Hitler is obviously noteworthy, despite expression of Nazism being important in some countries, like Germany.\n::''\"the subject is similar to bestiality\"'' - Correct. If bestiality was a more noteworthy and immediate, current issue in so many parts of the world today, it would be included on the list too. Since it's less noteworthy, it's not included, and rightly so; the list is an analysis of the most significant encyclopedic articles to write about, not a judgment of the most pleasant, good, righteous, lawful, or moral topics to write about.\n::''\"and if you want to write about it in your language do so.\"'' - If I want to write about it in any article, there is no policy against my doing so. The same applies to any noteworthy topic on any subject. Wikipedia's various languages are (at least in principle) divided ''solely on a linguistic level''. The only difference between the English Wikipedia, the Chinese Wikipedia, and the Finnish Wikipedia is the language they are written in; every single one should, ideally, have all noteworthy perspectives on the subject matter in question, regardless of what language or country they were originally written in. Wikipedia is not a tool for propaganda or censorship, in this or ''any other'' language, and that's never going to change. Sorry for the bad news.\n::''\"Do not force your sicknesses on every people ND in the world,\"'' - What \"sickness\" are you talking about? The sickness of encyclopedic, neutral coverage of topics? If you continue to make acidic personal attacks and insinuations on my character, motivation, and personal life, I will be forced to . This is your only warning; please remain civil in this discussion. Or at the very least provide ''evidence'' and ''reasoning'', not rhetoric and jabs, to support your claims; at least ''that'' would progress the discussion, rather than try to drag it down into a battle.\n::''\"I will continue to expose and resist your sick scheme tooth and nail by any means possible for me, if this is what you have set in your mind that your purpose is to recruit deviant and sick, sinful and backward  behaviours to all the peoples and languages of the world.\"'' - As I said, this is your final warning. I have no interest in exchanging personal attacks with you. I am here to improve the utility and value of this list. If you have a problem with maintaining a basic level of tolerance or understanding of your fellow human beings, that's your own personal issue, and you should use a personal website to promote that view, not Wikipedia.

Unless you have anything more valuable to contribute to this page besides bigotry and empty rhetoric, you should stop wasting the time of editors who are genuinely concerned with improving this list of articles. Wikipedia does not promote the various views it discusses - Wikipedia certainly does not promote, say, drug overdose, but that doesn't mean that it can't talk about John Belushi's death, or any other topic relating to drug overdose. If drug overdose were not a uniformly-negative subject, then talking about any positive aspects of it would also not be promoting it. Wikipedia aspires to a Neutral Point of View on all subjects, and the majority of editors regularly attempt to bring that quality to every article.

Both are NPOV violations.\n\n:Also, this compromise was reached by consensus (because if subcategories of \"sexuality\" are left to the individual Wikipedias then where it is an illegal offence to promote homosexuality, the article can be left out to avoid breaking the law).

There are many items on this list that clearly don't belong there, many that clearly do belong there, and many that are in a grey-zone where we will need to talk about the reasons why and why not to have such an article included. The current list is, by and large, haphazard and arbitrary, with inconsistent coverage that demonstrates bias both by culture and by field of knowledge; it is ruled by the whims of whoever happens to edit it on each day, with no real method of determining what stays and what goes beyond each individual user's personal conception of the relative \"importance\" of all these articles. As long as this situation continues, this page will be of minimal use to the many Wikipedias. The ''first'' step in tightening and bulking up this page should be to figure out a way to address the hundreds and hundreds of articles on this list which may have their importance disputed.\n\nAlthough I welcome any suggestions for how best to pursue this goal (or any other comments whatsoever), if some specific ideas are what you're looking for, I propose, first of all, that we create a \"removed\" list for storing all the entries whose importance has not been established. (A similar practice has been instituted, highly successfully, on several lengthy (and prone to continuous expansion) lists on Wikipedia. Perhaps have it at [[Talk:List of articles all languages should have/Removed]]?) This will encourage users to discuss and justify both removals and additions, will keep former staples of the list that are later deemed not significant enough from being lost and forgotten entirely, and will make the list in general easier to deal with by not crushing us with the weight of quasi-noteworthy entries. Second, we should go through each section of this page, one at a time, and discuss (and possibly vote on, if there's any support for that) the various entries of each and whether there are any important missing topics, or any topics that should be removed. This will make the page less fluid and more stable, and thus a more reliable resource, at least for ascertaining what most editors think the most necessary articles are.\n\nOnce ''that's'' out of the way and we've made quite a few removals and additions, we can start discussing ways to make the individual entries more useful to our readers, such as by adding one-sentence descriptions of each article (which will also help establish ''why'' each entry provided is noteworthy, which is currently very unclear to anyone reading this list, though the new links to the English Wikipedia help that greatly), grading entries on a 1-3 scale of importance (e.g., \"1\" for articles like \"language\", \"2\" for articles like \"grammar\", and \"3\" for articles like \"english language\", in decreasing order of centrality), and/or list various translations of the entries in the most common languages of Wikipedias&mdash;there are many interesting possibilities to discuss in the future, but we can't begin to really delve into and debate how to expand this page's format until we've gone over the specific entries in enough depth to confirm their reliable status (so we don't end up wasting too much more time by saving the reworking of the list's entries until ''after'' they've been expanded) as \"articles all languages should have\", to at least establish a stable position to ''start'' from. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 02:56, 30 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n: My personal opinion: Do not plan to have a single list of articles all languages should have; instead, have two lists. The first list should be the 1000 articles which all languages should have. The second should contain 4000 - 9000 additional articles which are '''in addition''' to the top 1000.\n\n: Criteria for the top 1000 will be varied, and disputed. Wikipedias are not primarily used for research, but for answering questions. For this reason, usefulness and popularity of an article are of greater importance than historic or effectual value. <nowiki>[[George W. Bush]]</nowiki> is a more important figure than <nowiki>[[George Washington]]</nowiki> of Mount Vernon in this scale, to use a US-centric example.\n\n: Criteria for the additional articles may be somewhat looser; there is more room, so pick the top number of entries and stop worrying about inclusion/exclusion until that number has been reached. At that time, budget the number of entries by field, and allow persons focused on those fields to determine relative importance (again, I would stress usefulness over academic value; <nowiki>[[birth control in humans]]</nowiki> is not as useful as<nowiki>[[condom]]</nowiki>.) - [http://journowiki.org/wiki/User:Amgine Amgine] / <sup>[http://journowiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Amgine talk] [[User talk:Amgine|meta]]</sup> 03:10, 30 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Your suggestion about having two lists seems '''extremely''' reasonable to me. It is, in fact, one of the ways I'd imagined possibly implementing the \"1-3\" system I specified above: 1-2 would be listed on a single, compact page, while 3 (i.e. the more borderline entries, still very important but not quite as \"vital\") would be listed in a much more expansive version. Or something like that, anyway. The only thing I disagree on is the exact numbers you suggested we make the lists adhere to; I don't see the value of forcing the list to adhere to an artificial, set number of articles just because it seems more orderly. Each list should be exactly as long as it merited by the number of topics that meet that page's standards of importance, be that 500 articles or 5,000. We should worry about being consistent in how we apply our standards to each page, not about how many entries are on each page total (at least not in a specific way; if either page gets bloated in a ''general'' sense (e.g., having 10,000 entries instead of 1,000 would be a big problem, but having 1,400 would not) that's indeed an issue). But, yes, I think that would indeed be the most organized, and valuable, way to deal with this project: an ideal mix of inclusivity and strictness of standards.\n::''\"For this reason, usefulness and popularity of an article are of greater importance than historic or effectual value.\"'' - I'm not sure I understand, perhaps because I tend to mean the same thing when I say \"useful\" and \"valuable\"; if something's valuable, how could it be useless to our readers? I think I agree in principle, though, if what you're saying is that we should concern ourselves with the practical issue of giving our readers basic knowledge on the most essential topics, rather than with more esoteric concerns such as qualifying whether this topic or that one is more objectively important. Perhaps if you clarified what you mean a bit, I'd be more sure that I agree with what you're saying.\n::''\"Wikipedias are not primarily used for research, but for answering questions.\"'' - Perhaps, but Wikipedias are still ''encyclopedias'', not FAQs.\n::''\"George W. Bush is a more important figure than George Washington of Mount Vernon in this scale, to use a US-centric example.\"'' - I only half-agree. Though I honestly wouldn't be especially averse to seeing a list that includes G. Bush and not G. Washington (and I'd certainly place both Bush and Washington much higher on the scale of relevance to this list than other \"founding father\" American history staples like Franklin, Jefferson and Adams), I think we should, at least to some extent, minimize the natural tendency of editors to be biased towards modern events vs. historical ones. Though the utilitarian model does, in general, prefer current situations to past ones, and I don't object to this being implemented on ''some'' level, to distinguish Washington and Bush to such an extreme level that Bush is definitely kept and Washington definitely excluded seems to be overdoing it: temporal bias is already a bad problem on most Wikipedias, and we shouldn't worsen it by excessively favoring recent history over earlier history). Part of the reason for having a list like this is to remind people of important articles they might forget to make, which means that sticking entirely to the articles that are already the most popular and commonplace ones on every Wikipedia rather defeats the purpose of this project. Overall, I think we should strike a balance between appealing solely to the most popular, modern topics, and being completely apathetic to whether something happened yesterday (9/11) or 2000 years ago (the burning of Rome); the latter's just plain unrealistic and unhelpful, but the former's rather too short-sighted and will cause this list to change rapidly with new trends and current events, which is harmful as well and will undermine the stability and reliability of the listings. (For example, one issue is: will we update the list with the new U.S. president every single time one comes into office? Though Bush is noteworthy enough to be indisputably necessary on this list, not every future president will necessarily be the same, despite the U.S.'s current central importance in world politics.)\n::''\"so pick the top number of entries and stop worrying about inclusion/exclusion until that number has been reached.\"'' - I'll have to disagree with you here again. Such a method would just cause the list to be deeply biased towards whichever things the first editors to work on that list are most interested in, and biased ''against'' any later editors' additions. We should apply the same standards to a certain article that's been suggested for inclusion, regardless of whether we currently have 12 or 3,500 articles out of a 3,500 maximum. Important is important. This is also one of the reasons I don't like the idea of an arbitrary, set limit of articles to ''either'' list: it will inevitably either lead to bloat (as people add relatively trivial entries just to fill up space), favoritism and exclusion of some topics in favor of others (as newly-suggested entries aren't added simply because there are already too many entries in the list), or, most likely, both. If we're diligent in applying standards of importance to every article that's added to both lists, it won't matter exactly how large&mdash;or how small&mdash;either one gets.\n::''\"At that time, budget the number of entries by field,\"'' - This also seems like a very bad idea to me (unless I'm misinterpreting what you mean by \"budget by field\"). What if there just happen to be more much-needed entries in \"biography\" than in \"mathematics\", in \"geography\" than in \"history\", or in \"biology\" than in \"chemistry\"? Why set arbitrary maximums or minimums on lists, when we can't be certain ahead of time what the ideal number for any section or field will be? It's just a simple fact that some fields of human knowledge have more vitally-important distinct articles to be written about than others; we should have more distinct articles from the field of anatomy, for example, than from the field of psychology, even though both are very important fields&mdash;not because anatomy is necessarily more important than psychology, but because more of the ''concepts'' in anatomy require distinct articles to clearly explain (for example, lungs, heart and brain are higher-priority separate articles than ego, supergo and id). Artificial limits will cause more harm than benefit, and more bureaucracy than order.\n::''\"again, I would stress usefulness over academic value\"'' - I partially agree, but remember that academic value is a ''type'' of usefulness; Wikipedia is still a general encyclopedia, and not a how-to manual or self-help book. I think I get your point, though I'm not sure I agree (why is \"condom\" more important than \"birth control\" if the concept of condoms, and many other forms of birth control, are surely ''discussed'' in the \"birth control\" article, making \"condom\" a daughter article of sorts?).\n::But those sorts of details can be worked out later; right now, the main issue is how to get from where we're currently at (an overlarge and rather disorderly list of all sorts of \"articles all languages should have\") to where we want to be at (which seems to be two separate lists); should we start going through the list and discussing which entries belong on \"list A\" (1 and 2 on my importance/necessity scale), \"list B\" (3 on my importance/necessity scale), and neither list (less important or necessary than 3)? Or should we just pick out individually the ''clearly'' \"list A\" entries (like \"human\", \"science\", \"war\", \"plant\"), and then worry about sorting the less noteworthy ones afterwards? In other words, should we start at the top of the list and work our way down the various sections, or start with the most obviously noteworthy ones and then branch outwards into the steadily more \"grey-area\" articles? -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 03:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n: Here's my reasoning:\n:* Number-limited lists\n:*: The purpose of the list is, primarily, to prioritize article creation/translation for wikipedias, to develop a \"seed\" of usefulness for these wikipedias.\n:* Usefulness vs. value\n:*: It is far more valuable to have a dozen articles about the US presidency, its position in politics and law, foreign policy, etc. But for someone on the [[w:ne:Main page|Nepali wp]] they likely are only interested in information about the current US president. Things people want the answer to '''now''' are of greater importance than articles which are extremely useful background information to those pop-culture needs. An article about forms of government is less useful than an article about rice. Priority should be on articles which are extremely popular over many languages, and on simpler over-views rather than in-depth knowledge. Leave room for each language to develop the articles, to make it relevant to their milieu.\n:* Budgeting numbers of articles\n:*: The majority of these articles will initially be translated by non-native speakers to the wikipedia in question. Maintaining interest beyond the top 1000 for these translators will be difficult; keeping a relatively low number of articles within a field of interest (Humanities, Science...) allows an achievable goal while also giving them a reasonable area of influence (I know much about a subset of human health services, and should be able to have input there, but not in the field of modern culture or history of African cultures.)\n:* Choosing smaller rather than broader\n:*: Yes, I know I argued the opposite above. The choice of condom vs. human birth control is one of scope. The condom is the most common form of artificial birth control in the world; it requires little explanation in any setting, and its use can be grasped without language. Attempting to explain the cultural relevance of the rhythm method or the legal/religious discussions related to RU-486 would almost certainly be an element of human birth control, and be almost impossible to make translatable to every language. Choices like these should be made, to select what is immediately useful, and reserve the background article for later development.\n\n: My suggestion: set limits; people work better to a limit and a deadline. Set a deadline (Alpha release of list on 1 May 2005, for example), knowing the list will be revised continually but trying to get a product available for translating teams to begin with. Then others may make plans based on the efforts here. Start a section for the top 1000, separate from the over-large list. And begin. - [http://journowiki.org/wiki/User:Amgine Amgine] / <sup>[http://journowiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Amgine talk] [[User talk:Amgine|meta]]</sup> 04:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Well, personally I wouldn't be that sure with this \"usefulness vs. value\" thing. Yes, you are right, it's highly more probable that people look for recent information. However, on the other hand, they have a plenty of souces to find it. Being honest, if only they watch TV news and read newspapers they actually know a bit who is Mr Bush (rare nations are so self-centred as Americans :P ). Some historical or specific data can be much more useful becuase of rarity.\n::Re other choices (quotas vs. non-quotas, one step vs. 2, 3 or road map etc.) I'm afraid that there is no perfect choice but two- or three- step solution seems to be fine (the language projects are on diferent stages of their development).\n::Re ways of making decision - I think a larger group of people should be involved and culture-'''un'''centred '''experts''' and participants from other language projects should be asked (there does exist a language bareer - English - on Meta).

I wonder, if we asked each 'pedia to submint the top five articles it feels are most important to know about to a list, what would the overall list end up looking like?

[[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] 13:08, 30 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n*After further consideration, I've changed my mind about having two lists. At least for now, such a move would be premature and inefficient. However, I do like very much the idea of distinguishing between the ''urgently'' important entries in the list (like \"History\" and \"Earth\" and \"Big Bang\"), and other important, but not quite as important, entries in the list (like \"Martial arts\" and \"Tornado\" and \"European Union\"), but I think we should distinguish them, at least to begin with, by bolding the more important ones, rather than by doing anything fancy like page-shuffling. In other words, we'll have highly important articles like \"Year\" in bold, but less important articles like the specific ''months'' of the year unbolded (though \"Month\" itself may be bolded too). ''After'' we've finished trimming the list and bolding the most important entries on the list, ''then'' it may be feasible to create one or two smaller lists based on the main list: certainly one that only has the bolded entries, and possibly also one that only has the unbolded ones. The reason for this is that if we ''start off'', before anything's settled yet, by splitting the article up, it will lead to a very disorganized and decentralized situation, and we'll inevitably lose track of a lot of articles in the midst of all the entry-moving and sporadic changes and reverts that will be going on; the two-edit process of removing an article from one list and then adding it to another will, I'm quite certain, cause lots of unnecessary labor, and lots of inconsistencies and repetitions and missed entries. Far simpler to make the process a simple matter of bolding or unbolding certain entries, and far less likely to cause any accidents to occur. Plus it makes it easier to organize the page if we follow your logic and decide that many specific topics (like \"condom\") are more important than general topics (like \"birth control\"); by having the two pages merged as one, we can indent \"condom\" properly to show that it's a daughter article of \"birth control\" (since it's a specific ''type'' of birth control), but we can bold \"condom\" and leave \"birth control\" unbolded if we end up deciding that condom's important enough for \"List A\", but birth control is only important enough for \"List B\" (which I'd dispute, but I'm just giving a hypothetical example). Likewise, we might want to keep the animal listing as organized as it is now, with \"Insect\" a subarticle of \"Arthropod\" and \"Mammal\" a subarticle of \"Chordate\", but we'll probably end up with \"Mammal\" as a more important article than \"Chordate\" because of what a common and central term it is, in which case we can simply bold \"Mammal\" and leave \"Chordate\" unbolded (unless we end up deciding that \"Chordate\" is so unimportant that we shouldn't even have it on List B, which I'd dispute as well, but that's certainly an option). So, overall, I say it's much better to distinguish the two lists by bolding certain entries and leaving other entries unbolded, at least until the two lists are stable enough that we aren't constantly moving entries from one list to the other (which will surely be the case for some length of time, as we discuss the various placements of each article). Once they're relatively stable, we can use ''both'' systems fairly easily. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 21:47, 30 March 2006 (UTC)\n\n==\"Can we *talk* first?\"==\nIn response to Aegis Maelstrom: That's exactly what I've been trying to cause to happen. It's been 3 or 4 days without any discussion here whatsoever; it's like I said, this place is too inactive. I'm delighted that my last edit to the page caused you to review as well which actors and directors merit listing, and I will continue to make such edits in the hope of provoking discussion so consensuses can be reached.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm starting to compile a rough draft of my own list of which entries we should bold/move to List A, so that discussion on differentiating the two levels of \"shouldness\" in the \"list of articles all languages should have\" can begin. Anyone else who's interested is free to do the same, and we can then compare and discuss our respective lists to get a good idea for where to start from and what different people's conceptions of the two lists are. Just keep in mind that (1) a lot of entries will probably be removed and added in the coming days, and (2) the \"List A\" of entries should be ''very short'' (at the very least to begin with) and ''very selective''; if both lists are thousands of entries long, then the whole point of dividing the list (to provide a manageably short list of ''especially'' necessary articles too) is missed. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 16:22, 1 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Raw materials and energy ==\n\nI would propose [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station Power Station] for this topic, because running power plants are substantial for our society. --[[User:80.142.218.156|80.142.218.156]] 09:20, 2 April 2006 (UTC) Markus Schwei\u00df, Deutschland\n\n:Sounds like a reasonable addition, though a clearer explanation for why \"power station/plant\" is one of the most necessary articles on a Wikipedia would be appreciated; what information do such articles provide that the articles about the energy sources themselves don't?

If we do add a third 20th-century American/British pop/rock musician along with Elvis Presley and The Beatles, if anything we should probably go with Michael Jackson, both for his significance as a musician and for his notoriety as a celebrity. But at this point, I don't think we need to add too many similar musicians to the list (though certainly I'm willing to discuss all possibilities, if anyone disagrees!), as it's too easy to risk bloat.\n\nAlso, on a side-note, we should probably add Tchaikovsky to the list of musicians and composers; he seems to be the most glaring ommission currently. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 04:03, 5 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Choosing which entries to bold==\nThis is a (very) rough draft of the list of entries which I would recommend bolding. The list is fairly \"safe\" (i.e. few surprises) and simple, and also fairly Western-centric, so I welcome any attempts to expand on it (or to dispute any of the ones I listed, of course), though I think if it is expanded, it should only be expanded ''very little'': we should be extremely strict in which biographical entries we bold (and only somewhat less strict in which we allow on the page ''at all''), for example, and should probably avoid having more than 15&ndash;20 bolded; the fewer the better, as it makes working through the huge list much easier, which is the entire purpose of dividing the list into bold and non-bold entries: to have a greatly-shortened list and a relatively expansive one. But, yeah, this is just a place to start from; it's extremely incomplete and I was hoping for more discussion first, but since this place is so inactive, maybe if I keep chugging along it'll attract more interest.\n\n* Biography\n** Actors, dancers and models: None\n** Artists and architects: Vincent van Gogh, Michelangelo, Pablo Picasso\n** Authors, playwrights and poets: Dante Alighieri, Homer, William Shakespeare\n** Composers and musicians: Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n** Explorers: Christopher Columbus\n** Film directors and screenwriters: None\n** Inventors, scientists and mathematicians: Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton\n** Social scientists: Aristotle, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Plato\n** Politicians, leaders and aristocrats: George W.

All it has is a lame cop-out, making the unreasonable and completely unhelpful demand that every Wikipedia have an article on ''every'' country, with absolutely no differentiation or prioritization between whether we need an article on [[en:India|India]] or on [[en:Swaziland|Swaziland]] first. This is both absurd and highly impractical. Clearly the only reason we resorted to this is to avoid any possibility of being accused of bias for choosing one country and not another, but I don't see why this is a problem solely for ''that'' part of the page and not for ''any other''. If we managed to be so selective with which ''religions'' and ''languages'' we included on this list, even though there's just as much of a chance of someone being offended by not having theirs included, then surely we should be able to do the same for \"countries\". At the very least, even if we do not differentiate between countries, we should ''list'' them all here, so users don't have to visit another page to see them. But I think that the much more valuable method for dealing with countries would be to handle them consistently and fairly by treating them just the same as articles on every other topic: create a working list, a rough draft, of highly noteworthy and significant countries, and then invite everyone to add and remove entries from the list so we can slowly, over time, chisel it down into the best list we can manage. As a rough goal to aim for, I'd say that we should have about '''100''' countries total, about '''15''' of which should be bolded. Obviously this is not set in stone, and can increase or diminish over time (whichever's most beneficial), but I think that's a good place to start from. We should then, if there's worry about disputes arising, provide ''explanations'' for why every single country we list is important enough to be included on such a selective list. This will help avoid most of the POV disputes that could arise if we didn't make explicit which aspects of the countries we're choosing (like population, history, economic status, etc.) if justifying its inclusion in the list.\n\nSo, what do you say? Shall we try it? -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 07:02, 13 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n*I've set up a working rough draft-in-progress at [[w:User:Silence/Countries]]. Feel free to edit it there; if anyone wants me to move it to a MediaWiki page, I'll gladly do so. As soon as there's support for this addition (or if, as with my past few suggestions, once again everyone else is out to lunch), I'll make the addition so it can receive more attention from editors of various backgrounds. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 08:18, 13 April 2006 (UTC)\n**Hi, I looked over your list. I think it is a good idea to have subset of countries for the purposes here. I think that bolding Spain would be a good idea, because of historical importance and because Spanish is one of top 5 most common mother tongues. We might want to expand that top 15 up to top 25 so that we can include countries like Italy and Canada (both are G8 countries and of course Italy is historically important) and South Korea, Mexico and Egypt as well. Hong Kong, Malaysia, Myanmar and Palestine probably should go up to the 100 list. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 03:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n**Thanks for the help! Lessee.. this'll be tricky..\n**Alright, those additions seem reasonable enough, though I'm reluctant to add too many bolded entries (because if we have 25-30 rather than 10-15 it'll be much harder to say \"no\" to anyone's requests that we bold ''more'' countries, which will eventually make the bolding distinction an irrelevant one because it'll be too large!). Also, \"Spanish language\" (which covers much of Spain's linguistic importance) and \"Ancient Rome\" (which covers much of Italy's historical importance) are already included in the main List, so I don't think bolding them primarily on linguistic and historical grounds is especially necessary (plus the bolded-list already has too much of a Eurocentric bias, having, for example, 0 African countries). Canada, however, is definitely a borderline one, and I've already strongly considered adding it to the list, but have been reluctant partly because of the Anglocentric bias it might demonstrate to have the US, UK, Australia and Canada all on such a short-short list of top-priority countries (I was reluctant to add \"Australia\" originally too, but caved in partly on the grounds that it's the only country that one could also get away with listing as a \"continent\").\n**The only country addition you recommended for the 100 list that I won't be adding is \"Hong Kong\", because it's already listed (and, in fact, bolded) in our list of \"Cities\". -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 06:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n**Overall, I'd be much, much more receptive to any requests that we make the list ''smaller'' than 100 entries than to requests that we make them ''larger'', because the list is both more useful and more easy to keep NPOV when we have enough entries that the excluded ones are in the majority, rather than the minority&mdash;as soon as they're in the minority, we're in big trouble because we're practically going out of our way to say they're unimportant, rather than reserving \"inclusion on this list\" status for an extremely selective and careful listing, as we should. As such, even more than recommendations for countries to ''add'' to the \"included\" list, I'd love to hear countries that should be ''removed'' from the \"included\" list (at least until a good enough rationale can be provided for them being listed). Otherwise it'll just become too bloated to be useful, and will overpower the rest of the \"Geography\" section. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 06:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Silence, here are some list triming suggestions and more on adding a few top bolded entries. An issue to consider is if listing all these countries under geography is the way to go. I think listing and linking to the general country articles under some other part of the list (which all include links to geography articles and many other aspects of countries) might be a better approach. The nation state is a basic category of analysis in all macro level social sciences. \n\n:From the current list of 43 countries on the meta page, one could drop Monaco and Vatican City (or move VC to the city list even if VC is a country technically).\n\n:In addition to the above, from the list of top 100 countries on your use page, you could drop (mostly because they are tiny -- having high living standard is not everything, as in Barbados and Luxembourg) the following. I don't see why these tiny countries should be on list when larger countries in their region are not: Barbados, Burundi, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Luxembourg, Monaco, Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Slovenia. In another pass, perhaps more countries could be removed. \n\n:Well, I'll try again for Spain and Italy: I think Spain should be a featured country because not only of language but also because of it's history of colonization (related) and being a key power in Europe, its key role in channeling Islamic learning and culture to Europe, the global appeal of Latin culture (of course related to language and colinization), and it would be nice for a Mediterranean power to be featured: either Italy or Spain, I would think. Spain has a very vital history of grass roots democratic movements (a rather important one). Spain is growing again as an economic power -- one of top 10 or 11 in world (though Italy's economy is larger). The legacy of this Spanish (and Italian) versions of socialist political theory in Latin America, Spain and Italy are becoming important on the global stage today through global justice/anti-globalization movements. Very important. Also, Italian and Spanish are amongst the top 10 Wikipedias (not that we want Poland as a top 15 country article, but Wikipedia size is another factor). On Italy: Not only was Italy of fundamental importance in the ancient times but also in the middle ages and also in the Renaissance. Hmm.  If Indonesia is in, we should add Italy and Spain and South Korea, while we're at it.  Perhaps make 20 countries the cut off. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 19:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n\nFor reference, here is a World Bank list of top 15 economies: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29 List of countries by GDP (PPP)]\n\nRank \tCountry \tGDP (PPP)\n\u2014 \tWorld \t55,938,191\n\u2014 \tEuropean Union \t12,020,939\n1 \tUnited States \t11,628,083\n2 \tPeople's Republic of China \t7,123,712[2]\n3 \tJapan \t3,774,086\n4 \tIndia \t3,362,960\n5 \tGermany \t2,325,828\n6 \tUnited Kingdom \t1,832,252\n7 \tFrance \t1,744,352\n8 \tItaly \t1,621,372\n9 \tBrazil \t1,482,859\n10 \tRussia \t1,408,603\n11 \tSpain \t1,046,249\n12 \tMexico \t1,014,514\n13 \tCanada \t993,079\n14 \tSouth Korea \t980,694\n15 \tIndonesia \t779,719\n--[[User:Vir|Vir]] 19:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Ps. I see that the list of countries (and perhaps cities) under the geography section are linked to main multi-disciplinary articles on those. This is very good as the general country articles better coverage of the importance of those countries. These categories may be misplaced. Countries are a main marco level unit of analysis in all the social sciences. I think the country and city articles should be moved from the geography section to the society section. If that makes for a large society category, it can't be helped. Countries as discussed in the linked articles are units of society not geographical topics. Clarity is better than evening things out. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 20:03, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Pps. One could shorten the bolded country list links and much reduce the Euro-centric character of the bolded countries by having EU as a bolded item -- it is in a sense a network state -- and unbolding all European countries.  I think you could include Mexico and Egypt then.  With that, you have all the most major long term civilization areas of the planet covered. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 23:47, 14 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n*''\"An issue to consider is if listing all these countries under geography is the way to go.\"'' - A lot of the current organizational system is based on what's most convenient, rather than on what's strictly and absolutely accurate. That's we have \"history\" as its own top-level section, rather than as a sub-section of \"society\" or somesuch; its shorthand for \"events\", like \"geography\" is shorthand for \"places\". So, one big reason not to move \"cities\" or \"countries\" to \"society\", even though they're political and social entities at least as much as geographic, is because it would excessively bloat the \"society\" section and leave the \"geography\" section (which is already relatively small and limited) severely deficient. It's just easier to navigate through the list that way, and it makes such on an intuitive, even if not a technical, level to have countries listed alongside continents.\n*''\"The nation state is a basic category of analysis in all macro level social sciences.\"'' - Then add the article \"[[en:nation-state|nation-state]]\" to the \"Society\" section. :) -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 03:09, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\n*''\"From the current list of 43 countries on the meta page, one could drop Monaco\"'' - I included Monaco mainly because it's the most densely populated country in the entire world, the second-smallest independent state in the world (after Vatican City), the largest police force and presence (per capita and per area) in the world, etc. But I suppose that in such a selective list, most of those are relatively trivial and semantic claims to fame, so I don't oppose removing Monaco.\n*''\"Vatican City (or move VC to the city list even if VC is a country technically).\"'' - I don't want Vatican City removed from the list altogether; its a hugely important city in global religion and even politics, despite its small size. But certainly moving it to the \"Cities\" list seems reasonable to me, even if technically inaccurate; it's only fair, really, considering that \"Hong Kong\" is also listed under \"Cities\".\n*''\"Barbados, Burundi, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Luxembourg, Monaco, Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Slovenia. In another pass, perhaps more countries could be removed.\"'' - A good start! I'm delighted to have some removal suggestions, as I have little confidence in my own ability to gauge the importance of most countries. It is indeed true that most of those were added because they scored especially high (or especially low) on certain statistics regarding population, quality of life, poverty, etc.; in lieu of a better way to determine noteworthiness, I went with some lists like that to start from. However, since you justify removing those entries largely based on their size, do keep in mind that I don't think we should consider geographic size a very important factor in inclusion. Population size is much more important; the geographic size of many countries and states is rather arbitrary.\n*''\"Also, Italian and Spanish are amongst the top 10 Wikipedias (not that we want Poland as a top 15 country article, but Wikipedia size is another factor).\"'' - Actually, even though I'm a very big Italian history enthusiast, I'd consider Poland to be almost as important as Italy and Spain, especially if one puts more weight on recent history than on older history. Additionally, I ''strongly'' feel that the size of the Wikipedias of certain languages should not be too much considered in determining what should be included in this list, as that would worsen some of Wikipedia's systemic biases (for example, much of the reason certain language Wikipedias have more articles than others is based on how widespread computer and Internet use is, and other cultural factors). Furthermore, your argument about languages, again, is a stronger argument for including \"Italian language\" in the article than for including \"Italy\". However, I'm not strongly opposed to bolding Italy and Spain, so, pending further discussion, although I still have a fair number of reservations, I'm OK with adding them to the bolded list. Thank you for taking the time to explain your reasoning to me; discussions like these are what this list is most in need of.\n*''\"If Indonesia is in, we should add Italy and Spain and South Korea, while we're at it.\"'' - Why South Korea and not North Korea? Economic status is not the only factors in choosing countries.\n*''\"Perhaps make 20 countries the cut off.\"'' - I don't think we need a hard, absolute cut-off at any specific number, but we should certainly be ''very'' careful about which countries we bold and which we don't. Bolding more countries is a slippery slope that could lead (and I personally feel already is starting to lead) to bloat that would make the list much less useful to small Wikipedias.  However, we'll just have to see how things turn out in the long run.\n*''\"One could shorten the bolded country list links and much reduce the Euro-centric character of the bolded countries by having EU as a bolded item -- it is in a sense a network state -- and unbolding all European countries.\"'' - '''Absolutely''' not. That's a cop-out, and \"European Union\" is already listed where it should be: under \"International organizations\", not \"Countries\". I'm glad you're thinking, though! It is, obviously, more important to avoid bias than it is to avoid the ''appearance'' of bias; if there happen to be more highly internationally noteworthy countries in Europe than in Africa, that's just the way things are, and we shouldn't try to change that for the sake of arbitrary Political Correctness. However, we should certainly do our very best to express a global, not just Western, view.\n*''\"With that, you have all the most major long term civilization areas of the planet covered.\"'' - The European Union is an economic and political organization, not a civilization. And for that matter, Mexico and Egypt, in their modern forms, are not \"major long term civilizations\" either, even if they coincide geogrraphically and nominally with ancient civilizations; and Italy is not Ancient Rome either. I feel that simply including them on the list, and including civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians and Incas and Romans and Ancient Greeks in the History section (perhaps we should discuss which of ''those'' should be bolded, since I haven't gotten around to bolding any of the \"Ancient History\" articles yet?), should suffice, even without bolding. As long as we're rather exclusive with who gets on the list ''at all'', it won't be considered a \"put-down\" to be on the list and not be bolded. It will start to become so if we lower our requirements too much and let Egypt, Mexico, Italy, Spain, and South Korea in, even though obviously all five of those places are very important. -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 03:09, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Since it is late, here are some points as they pop in my head: If you look at the GDP (PPP) table above, Mexico, Spain and Italy have higher GDP than Indonesia and Canada. That was part of my reasoning there. These are economic superpowers, compared to the rest of the world.  \n\n:PC/diversity is a good criteria for including one or a few of the 15 to 20 countries -- I think - so as to have one major country from each continent. Why not? \n\n:No, Egypt doesn't need to go bold. But, for PC reasons, some one African country should. Take your pick: Egypt, Nigeria, or South Africa. Nigeria has quite a large population (9th in world). Also, from memory, Nigeria may have been part of homeland of the expansion which drove the Niger-Congo language family across most of subsaharan Africa along along with a subsaharan package of agriculture. Niger-Congo is arguably the largest language family in the world. \n\n:Mexico is up there in GDP (the PPP version) -- the people and culture of ancient Mexico continue on in Mexico. Huge population too. \n\n:I think EU as a network state is on the way to being a super-country, like the U.S. and Russia and China and India. It is just less centralized (for the time being). I think you dismiss the EU as a unity too quickly (and for ideological reasons?). An argument can be made for reading EU as an economic-political and cultural bloc, more and more so, in various ways. In addition to legal and economic unifications, one key aspect of a modern state is will it defend it's interests militarily in a unified way -- EU is beginning to take small steps in this direction. Done. The big baby regional state is walking. I think it is near inevitable for EU to become a very complex nation state (not unlike India and China, with many languages). EU not a civilization? Hmm. I disagree. Modern Western Europe, while fragmented politically and somewhat linguistically, is a civilization with a great many economic, cultural and techno-scientific continuities (and with extensions around the world). Pomo be damned on that. Of course, now, this western civilization, driven to global supremacy by a complex of factors has been morphing into a global civilization blending with many localities and regional powers and global trends. Granted, most trade is still regional. But, this is gradually changing. (This is frighteningly so in the erosion of regulation, which might reverse eventually. But, how soon?) Anyway...\n \n:The cultures and empires of classical China, India, Europe, and Indonesia inspired their proximate and later successor states (and civilizations yes) and their diaspora beyond. I think this argument can be made in terms of linguistic, philosophical, religious, etc. continuities (or streams of development). The argument can be less made so for Mexico but I wonder about the areas of high concentration of indigenous population in the south. Persia, Iraq and Egypt are somewhat less so the case in continuity with their classical civilizations -- but their dominant cultures are moreso direct continuities of another great civilization sphere, the Islamic commonwealth. These are not whimsical connections: most of the super states today rest on the foundedations, in cultural-linguistic unity and in sheer population mass, that were established by the large empires of the past. So, your top 15 or 20 list will reflect this. The former colonies -- America, Australia, Brazil, and S. Africa-- seem to be the exceptions (unless you count them as extensions of European civ).  \n\n:Btw, I love Peru -- but it just doesn't pop out on the scales we are talking about.\n\n:Poland -- I almost mentioned Poland. Important, more so in early modern times. But you were wanting less, not more bolds, and I agree.  The GDP is not quite there. Population neither. Size neither. \n\n:Obviously population is an issue along with country size. These four criteria might do for cut offs in both bold and longer lists: PC (1 on each continent at least), GDP (PPP version), country size, and population size. This favors the legacy states of the old empires. Sigh. Keep it simple? Objective even? \n\n:The tiny countries: many have less than a few million population, even a few 100,000. These are small lakes of humanity compared to the oceans of humanity in large states.  New York or Mexico City or Mumbai alone would swallow 20 or more of them.  You are wanting a shorter list yes? I agree for top level encyclopedia purposes. If doing a course on states or an article on the nature of states: bring in all the variety. \n\n:I only mentioned the Wiki thing for Spain as one among many factors. If GDP is a key factor, Spain really should go in. \n\n:The more I think of it, the more I am found of the idea of de-bolding all the European places and just going with the EU -- all the European states are one click away then -- not just the big ones.  Be bold and unbold, eh? :) \n\n:Viewing the world as a global system: what are the major powers in the world today?  U.S., EU (gradually increasingly more so than the individual countries), India, China, Japan, Russia still for awhile (and maybe it will regenerate), Brazil perhaps, Mexico perhaps eventually, an Islamic alliance perhaps, a unified Korea perhaps (even ununified) or even an Asian economic bloc, a South American Union including Brazil perhaps and an African Union down the road and a SE Asain alliance. We are moving to an era of large regional states mostly as geopolitical players. Who else is can/will force their will in an era of various globalizations?  Large states are necessary developments in the face of (and sadly as instruments of) the force of transnational corporations and financial markets moving massive monetary and trade flows around. (Global networks of social movements, right and left, are fighting this, but won't stop it.) Times have changed. Perhaps let our outlines reflect this to an extent. \n\n:Why South Korea only? Why Russia and not Ukraine? Look at the GDP (PPP) chart. S. Korea is in Top 15. One could check other types of GDP tables at the link above to get different takes.  \n\n:Geography should perhaps be renamed to Places and Geography. Geography is quite misleading. Why have an encyclopedia with obfuscation at the top level. I'm not a fan of one word lables when two are three words accomplish much more (and indicate all sort of interesting connections) -- especially in a long list format like this.  In a table to manage data, OK, maybe you want single words. But you need clear labels for organizing meaning. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 05:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n:''\"Mexico, Spain and Italy have higher GDP than Indonesia and Canada. That was part of my reasoning there. These are economic superpowers, compared to the rest of the world.\"'' - But Indonesia has the 4th-largest population in the world! Compared to Spain (43,000,000), Egypt (75,000,000), Italy (60,000,000), Mexico (100,000,000), and South Korea (48,000,000), Indonesia (220,000,000) is a ''people'' superpower! Like I said earlier, economic status should not be our primary factor in determining what countries should be bolded. Population shouldn't either, but both popluation and economic status should only be sufficient to require bolding for the top 5 or so countries on the list; when we're getting down to below the top 10 (as you are getting with South Korea, etc.), more is required.\n:''\"PC/diversity is a good criteria for including one or a few of the 15 to 20 countries -- I think - so as to have one major country from each continent. Why not?\"'' - Because it's wasteful. We already have an article on each continent bolded. Like I said before, the list should be based on which countries are most internationally important, not based on which countries would make us look most PC. That's one of the main reasons I'd much rather have 10 countries bolded than 20: when you're only choosing about 10 countries out of a total of 7 continents, it's completely forgivable to not have a country from every continent bolded, and to have various other important countries not bolded. But when the requirements for bolding are so low that ''20'' countries make the list, it becomes a ''lot'' trickier to keep the list neutral and NPOV. I do't know that we really want to deal with that.\n:''\"No, Egypt doesn't need to go bold. But, for PC reasons, some one African country should.\"'' - Not if we find a way to shorten the list of bolded countries rather than grow it.\n:''\"Take your pick: Egypt, Nigeria, or South Africa.\"'' - All three of those countries are tempting. I'd also strongly consider the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Wikipedia claims that it is the only African country with a significant chance of becoming a major power this century, was the site of the deadliest conflict since World War II, and is the 12th-largest country in the world.\n:''\"I think EU as a network state is on the way to being a super-country, like the U.S. and Russia and China and India.\"'' - This is extremely speculative. EU's territory spans a much larger area than even the U.S. and China, and the vast majority of the EU's influence and international role is economic, not administrative. At this point, listing Europe (or the European Union) as a single country would be akin to listing the Middle East (or the Arab League) as one.\n:''\"I think you dismiss the EU as a unity too quickly (and for ideological reasons?)\"'' - What the ''hell''? Forgetting to [[en:Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assume good faith]], there? What \"ideological reasons\" are you insinuating that I have? I'm offended.\n:''\"An argument can be made for reading EU as an economic-political and cultural bloc, more and more so, in various ways.\"'' - The same argument could be made for reading the United States and Canada as an economic-political and cultural bloc, but that doesn't make them the same ''country''. Jeez.\n:''\"The GDP is not quite there. Population neither. Size neither.\"'' - The GDP and population are significant factors (though not overwhelmingly so), but the size of a certain country really ''isn't'' all that significant. The United Kingdom is the 78th-largest country in the world, yet surely you wouldn't call it less important than Kazakhstan, the 9th-largest country in the world, based on its size! I think we should stop worrying about geographic size so much; just because the countries are listed under \"Geography\" as a matter of convention (because they deal with places, even if those places are more geopolitically- than geographically-based) doesn't mean that their geographic features (such as altitude and climate and area) are of the highest importance.\n:''\"one key aspect of a modern state is will it defend it's interests militarily in a unified way -- EU is beginning to take small steps in this direction.\"'' - So? There are plenty of places that the United States would defend if attacked, that aren't a part of the United States. By your logic, the various twisted alliances in and preceding World War I constituted the formation of new countries just because the alliances required various countries to militarily defend each other. Until the [[en:European Union|European Union]] article is in a \"Countries\" category rather than an \"International organizations\" category (look at the bottom of the page!), your revolutionary reclassification theories are premature (and potentially offensive to many Europeans, who wouldn't want their countries removed from the list of important Countries just because they're members of a major international organization).\n:''\"Obviously population is an issue along with country size.\"'' - No, population is a major issue, size is a minor one. Antarctica is less internationally important than India despite being about four times as large geographically. If a country has large expanses of uninhabitable desert, why should that country be deemed more important than another country that would be equally large if one counted the significantly-inhabited regions only? Raw map size is a factor, but not a major one; Russia is bolded more for its historical and political importance than for its sheer size. The same applies to the U.S., India, Brazil and China; their size is a minor contributing factor to their being bolded, at best.\n:''\"If GDP is a key factor, Spain really should go in.\"'' - GDP is not a key factor (at least, not past the top 5 or so on the GDP list). GDP is certainly an important factor, but there are dozens of other important factors.\n:''\"The more I think of it, the more I am found of the idea of de-bolding all the European places and just going with the EU\"'' - A truly terrible idea. I'd actually say that the EU is currently vastly ''less'' important than a number of existing countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom (was the British Empire a \"country\", based on your evaluation?). Clearly your political leanings and hopes for the future are preventing you from making an unbiased evaluation of Europe. Perhaps you should stick to other continents until you get some hard evidence that EU is a country or get over that fantasy so that country-inclusion can be discussed reasonably. Even if EU becomes a country sometime in the ''future'' (which Wikipedia obviously shouldn't speculate about until it's actually happened!), it's blatantly clear that it's not one ''now'', which is all that should matter to us.\n:''\"Times have changed. Perhaps let our outlines reflect this to an extent.\"'' - Nope. Times have changed a great deal, yes, and we should reflect that in our list, but none of the developments you're fantasizing about (such as a unified, singular \"Asian bloc\" of power) are ''anywhere'' near actually existing at this point in time, or even in the foreseeable future. Your starry-eyed speculation about the future, no matter how strong your personal convictions are, cannot override the facts. Until Atlases and other encyclopedias start printing data based solely on these imaginary, futuristic supercountries instead of based on the actual, internationally-recognized existing countries of today, it would clearly be overstepping the line and POV-pushing to restructure a list like this based on absolute speculation. I, too, believe that the world is becoming increasingly globalized and centralized, and will continue to do so in the future, but that doesn't mean that we can rewrite the global geopolitical landscape for our own purposes just because we ''want'' to. Encyclopedias should reflect the facts of the past and present, not the imagined possibilities of the future; [[en:WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not a crystal ball]]. Moreover, \"viewing the world as a global system\" is just ''one'' way of viewing the world. Presenting hypothetical future situations as present-day truths is clearly a violation of Wikipedia's core policies, [[en:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]], [[en:Wikipedia:Verifiability|Verifiability]], and [[en:Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]].\n:''\"Why Russia and not Ukraine?\"'' - Because Russia is much more historically and politically significant (not to mention, since you're so fond of comparing countries' sizes, that it's the largest country in the entire world). That I added Ukraine to the list at all is more than sufficient. Answering a question with another question is not answering the question at all; why South Korea and not North Korea?\n:''\"Look at the GDP (PPP) chart. S. Korea is in Top 15.\"'' - I honestly don't especially care. Mexico, Spain and Italy all have a much higher GDP than South Korea, yet they aren't bolded either. This is a list of the most important topics for a small-sized Wikipedia to have articles about, not a raw list of which countries have the highest GDPs. In fact, there'd be even ''fewer'' high-GDP countries bolded if so many countries with huge populations and a lot of political influence didn't happen to also have high GDPs; the fact that the GDP ''coincides'' nicely with some of the bolded entries is just that: a ''coincidence''. GDP is not the be-all and end-all of the entire history, culture, geography, politics, social structure, and all other significant factors of every country in existence, and bolding countries based solely on their economic status is itself biased, because it forwards the idea that a country is only and entirely important because it has lots of ''money''. Obviously things aren't quite that simple.\n:''\"Geography is quite misleading.\"'' - No more misleading than \"history\" is. \"Geography\" deals with places, \"history\" with events. The fact that \"Geographic\" lists certain countries and other divisions that are geopolitical more than strictly geographic is no more significant than the fact that \"History\" lists certain events that are actually prehistoric! For that matter, \"Biography\" isn't confined solely to biographic data; it's just about \"People\". If you wanted, you could rename \"Geography\" to \"Places\", \"History\" to \"Events and periods\", and \"Biography\" to \"People\"; it'd be more accurate, it just wouldn't ''look'' as pretty. It's a pretty trivial issue. I'm more concerned with improving the list than with minor semantic quibbles like that. If you want clearer labels, I recommend simply adding brief descriptions clarifying the title's meaning to the beginning of those sections: add a single-sentence explanation at the top of \"Biography\" to note that it's for articles about people (not for articles about biographies!), at the top of \"History\" to note that it's for articles about events and periods in human (pre)history, and at the top of \"Geography\" to note that it's not just for strictly geographical topics, but for all sorts of articles about places. Would that be sufficient clarification? We could likewise add clarifying lines to the beginning of \"Society\" and \"Culture\" and \"Technology\", since those are all pretty abstract and vague concepts, and non-native-English-speakers may not fully understand them (and, for example, \"Technology\" is sometimes considered a subgrouping under \"Culture\", at other times a subgrouping under \"Science\"). A little bit of clarifying text should clear up most of that obfuscation you speak of without having to completely overhaul the page. It's particulraly important to use one-word section names rather than multi-word ones because this page is for numerous non-English Wikis, and simpler words like \"Geography\" are better than lengthy, elaborate clauses explaining the exactitudes of the section's requirements. (Of course, that's anoter good argument for just going with \"People\", \"Places\" and \"Events\" rather than fanciness of \"Biography\", \"Geography\" and \"History\". But then, that's another thing to discuss.) -[[User:Silence|Silence]] 18:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Hey, I'm sorry you were offended. I didn't mean to offend. I think you took offense too easily. No offense was intended. I meant by \"ideological\" that you had a theory that you strongly cared about in this and believed. (ps. various definitions of [[en:ideology]] are not \"judgemental.\") That was the only topic on which you had previously said \"absolutely\" not. So, that sounded like a very strong belief. It is not meant as an insult. I was figuring we could joust back and forth here with ideas and critiques.  I was partly jousting (a common thing in academic circles that I sadly spend too much time in) because your previous reply had seemed a bit dismissive about the EU state idea. Actually, I was just using contemporary social theory. See last paragraph below about Castells.\n\n::To the point: I think your counter examples above are not the best counters that could be given to the points I've made, which have more substance than you're granting. For instance, I mentioned repeatedly that EU is emerging as a \"Network\" state -- that is distinct from a country.  The network state is a different type of beast from the traditional capitalist nation state. But, it is an emerging type of state, for the EU. Wikipedia may not write about it yet. But, we should and will. I did say that down the road that an African bloc etc. might emerge and was in no way implying that was close to a reality.  \n\n::Though you criticized me for emphasizing some individual factors, I mentioned that 4 or 5 factors could be used together in selecting countries to bold. My general ideas in this have been considering various factors (see Spain at top), though my arguments may have emphasized specifics at times. For later: At the end of discussions such as this, I think it could help to summarize what factors are used to select bolded and general items.\n\n::Using one word titles for phrases for translation is an interesting point. Perhaps subtitles would be a way to get around this. People, places and events might be better. And nature for science. But, hmm, nature and science and place and geography still seem better to me. I don't think these are so difficult to translate. Very common words. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 20:31, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Anyway, again, no offense intended. Really. I was both jousting/arguing and offering a criticism. Social scientists use ideology in various ways -- as a set of strongly held beliefs is one way. And I wanted you to consider looking at your beliefs. Something perhaps to consider some time: [[en:Manuel Castells]], a prominent European social theorist (working in the U.S. now), very familiar with the EU and new social transformations, writes about the rise of the Network state in \"The Information Age\" trilogy, 3rd volume. Others disagree with his points. If you're familiar with that work, great. If not, I find Castells to be worth reading (and criticizing). Anyway, I'll be back to chat in a week or two -- I really have some big deadlines to meet. --[[User:Vir|Vir]] 20:22, 15 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Fix Greek language; Bold Lenin; Hebrew alphabet ==\n\nFix: Greek language is currently listed as \"Geek language\".\n\nBold: Vladimir Lenin should be bold.\n\nAdd: '''Hebrew alphabet'''.

Though a well-known figure in his day, Russell is not considered very significant now; in my philosophy degrees he was hardly mentioned. I'd say many (perhaps most) philosophers would consider Wittgenstein the most significant philosopher in the 20th century, even if they disagree with him; if not Witt, who else would be? [[User:84.70.132.186|84.70.132.186]] 12:21, 23 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I think that Russell was a relatively recent addition; if you want to remove his article, I won't object.

I realise that due to the nature of the list space is limited (or else I would suggest [[:en:Karl Popper|Karl Popper]] and [[:en:Gottlob Frege|Gottlob Frege]] as well, perhaps even [[:en:Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], [[:en:Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[:en:Saul Kripke|Saul Kripke]] as well), but Hume, Locke and Rawls are all very central figures in philosophy and extremely influential. These philosophers have all had a greater impact than say, [[:en:Ralph Waldo Emerson|Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[:en:Jean-Jeacques Rousseau|Jean-Jeacques Rousseau]] who are on the list. --[[User:140.180.133.77|140.180.133.77]] 04:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)\n\nI concur, although I'd say that Rousseau and Emerson are important as literary figures, and ought to be on the list.  People who don't study philosophy often don't realize that ''philosophes'' like Rousseau and Voltaire weren't, strictly speaking, philosophers.  Locke and Hume should definitely go on.  Rawls I'm ambivalent on. [[User:John Kenney|John Kenney]] 12:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Authors, playwrights and poets ==\nWhy are [[:en:Aeschylus|Aeschylus]] and [[:en:Euripides|Euripides]] not on the list since [[:en:Aristophanes|Aristophanes]] is? Arguably both of them are a lot more influential and important writers than Aristophanes. I also find it weird that neither [[:en:Democritus|Democritus]], the originator of ancient atomism, [[:en:Epicurus|Epicurus]], one of its most infulential thinkers, nor [[:en:Lucretius|Lucretius]], the most important and widely read author on ancient atomism (as well as a major literary figure in the history of Latin literature), is on the list, given the enormous impact ancient atomism had on early modern science. --[[User:140.180.133.77|140.180.133.77]] 14:08, 18 July 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Agree on Aeschylus and Euripides.  I would say that Epicurus, of the three atomists, makes the most sense (note that the ''only'' Latin literary figure at the moment is Virgil - I'd say Horace and Ovid should get added before Lucretius). [[User:John Kenney|John Kenney]] 12:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n== This list should be more honest about its biases ==\nI'm not quite sure I follow the point of this list, but it seems to me that it would be more appropriately titled \"A list of articles that Euro-centric English-speaking people think should be on every wikipedia\".  I don't necessarily feel that these kinds of articles/lists/projects need to be NPOV (such a thing would be entirely impossible), but the pretentions of this one seem a bit much, more even than lists of the 100 greatest films and the like.  In fact, I'm not against lists like this at all--I think they serve a valuable purpose, and we shouldn't waste out time wringing our hands about how to come up with a non-NPOV version of this list--but I think we should try to be clearer about the POV that they represent. [[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 06:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)\n:The discussion shows that the contributors have tried to take a global perspective. This is of course very difficult to do.

The better way is to try to change the selection to include more articles that are important in the non-English-speaking parts of the world, and remove some articles that aren't important for the people there. --[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] 06:44, 31 August 2006 (UTC)\n::::Well, some of the authors were clearly not terribly important - I removed Edna St. Vincent Millay and Carl Sandburg, who are minor authors at best.  But reducing the number of English language authors to, say, 5, seems really difficult to me.  Better to make the list bigger.  I could easily add a bunch of French language authors, and some authors for other languages.  But that makes the list bigger.  How sacred is the \"about 1000 articles\" limit? [[User:John Kenney|John Kenney]] 19:54, 31 August 2006 (UTC)\n:::::I thinkt it's good to have a limit, so that the list won't grow uncontrolled. 1000 articles has been the aim for a while, and I think it sounds pretty reasonable. --[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] 17:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)\n::::::There's already well more than a thousand articles.  The list isn't going to grow uncontrolled, because not too many people are working on it, and obvious cruft can get cleared away.    Of course the list will tend to grow as it goes on.  It's got some weird biases at the moment - towards computer scientists, for instance; is it really more important to have an article on [[en:Dennis Ritchie|Dennis Ritchie]] than it has to have one on, say, [[en:Marsupial|Marsupial]]s or [[en:Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]?  Of course not.  It just happens that the people who have contributed to the list have tended to be computer nerds.  The way to fix this is not to set some arbitrary number, but to allow the list to gradually balance itself by leaving it open and encouraging people to add names.  Every once in a while, somebody can come through and clear particularly bad names, like the obscure Norwegian politicians, minor American authors, and semi-legendary female rulers (the Queen of Sheba was on the list, but not King Solomon!  That's entirely absurd) who had somehow crept in when I found the place.  The basic fact is that there are well more than a thousand articles that all languages should have articles on, and any limitation is basically going to bias the list in favor of the currently odd balance, because people always feel more willing to add names than to remove them. The page is basically a goal for starting up wikipedias - these are articles that are reasonably high priority to add, on a basis which is hopefully beyond that of individual cultures, although of course it has a western, and particularly an anglophone, bias because of who has contributed to it.  Limiting the list, I think, especially to a number that has already been surpassed, will just stunt it and leave it with an odd, idiosyncratic set of choices. [[User:John Kenney|John Kenney]] 20:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::::::For what it's worth, I think [[en:Wikipedia:Vital articles]] (with just over 700 articles) is a much tidier list, though I haven't taken a close look to see if it's as balanced as it should be. I think a better approach, in any case, would be to create separate 100-article lists of important articles in certain areas: 100 most important cities, 100 most important authors, 100 most important politicians throughout history, etc. From these lists, the main 1,000-article list could be compiled if desired. This would be good for starting WikiProjects at our smaller wikis, since they have a decent number of articles to work on. It would also be useful for smaller projects, for which less specific topics, like historical events (wars etc.), would be a higher priority than individual figures in history; for which articles on the major languages are more important than articles on the writers that represent them. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Mxn|Minh Nguy\u1ec5n]] <small>([[User talk:Mxn|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Mxn|contribs]])</small> 02:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::::::I think any list of this sort is bound to be somewhat silly, but I think that, in general, it's likely to improve.  The idea of smaller lists does seem like a good idea.  I'd suggest, though, that something like \"the 100 most important politicians\" rapidly gets silly, just as \"the 1000 most important encyclopedia article topics\" does.  The more specific the better.  \"100 Most important British potlical figures,\" for instance, would make sense, because that allows for a level of commensurability - British political figures are essentially comparable to one another, and can thus be compared and a decent list thought up.  \"100 most important European monarchs\" would seem a sensible idea for a list - big enough to give some room to be expansive, small and specific enough that all examples are readily comparable.  Similarly, dividing up authors, either by nationality or by genre (or both) would likely give more comparable lists.  It's easier to say who the \"100 most important writers in the English language,\" or the \"100 most important poets\" are than it is to say who the \"100 most important writers\" are.  But that's just a refinement of your idea, which I think is a good one.  Once the more specific lists are made, one can move up a pyramid to construct broader and broader lists, until one gets to this one.  It's a rather expansive project, though. I think the basic issue is that there's just a ton of articles that an encyclopedia ought to have articles on, and that any genuinely full list is going to be highly discouraging. But I like making lists, so I'm going to fiddle about thinking about some of this. [[User:John Kenney|John Kenney]] 19:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)\n\n''(Breaking indent.)'' Yes, I like the idea of having more specific topics for lists, but it creates a lot more work, and I'm not sure we can find enough people to do it here at Meta. Though maybe it's possible over at the English Wikipedia, where some contributors have obviously been working towards a \"1.0 release\".

And it does not make a difference whether there are 100 countries on the list or all approx 200. Although this is in opposition with my argument at the cities section, that the list should not be too wide, the countries are a different case as the number is considerably smaller that the number of possible cities to include. If no counter arguments, I will put there all the countries. --[[User:Tone|Tone]] 11:24, 7 October 2006 (UTC)\n\n: I don't think that any disucssion based on \"reasoned rationale\" made by '''anyone''' (whose rationale is necessartily biased by his own cultural environment) will ever be conclusive.\n: The only bias-neutral list will one based purely on statistics collected from existing wikipedias. That's why I much favor making the list simply '''not sorted''' by topic or domain, but simply by pure statitics collected on at least the top-10 major wikis:\n: the articles with the greatest number of interwikis\n: sorted secondarily with the greates number of local links in those wikis.\n: The choice of source wikis to check should be the top-most ones, because the smallest ones have sometimes been expanded by bots importing massive numbers of stub articles with little importance (for example a list of French or US cities, whose source is easy to get, and easy to automate, and so easy to put in first place in the list of top-interwikis). This is the reason why I also think that getting the statistics about the articles with the most important number of local links is a big hint about how important a topic is, even on the largest interwikis.\n: I think you will be surprized to see that all the rationale above about which article to select is completely wrong, and totaly biased.\n: The list should not remainstatic, but should be updated each month after statistic collection. There would then be reports on all wikis to see how they implement the list: stubs would be created for missing articles, but this will still not allow changing much the local links statistics. So the \"global culture\" improved by the interwikicollection willnot completely erase the regional culture viewed by local links.\n: The two aspects (interwikis, and local links) are important: if a wiki has an article with lots of local links, it is most probably important to have it also in other languages, at least as a stub to be improved later, but from which the interwiki collection can start (collecting interwikis will help improving these stubs, by enhancing the translation effort).\n: More generally, such lists will really benefit to all wikis because lots of useful information will be found in other languages for articles with poor quality in some languages (including in the English, German or French wikis that have concentrated lots of efforts).\n: Additionally, these statistical lists should be developed (separately) on other interesting namespaces (\"Template:\", \"Category:\" and \"Portal:\") because they will help maintaining the general coherence of wikipedias and will allow wikis to improve their own local maintenance, typography, general aspect, and organization/classification of the content. Such tool would rapidly demonstrate that most wikis (including English!) could be largely improved with less centric bias, and more openness to other cultures and knowledge domains.\n: These lists don't need to be sorted by domain. A pure statistic sort is enough (at least at the start). The classification by domain will follow the general evolution of wikis for their local organization of their own content!\n: Then completing the list by cultural/scientific domain should be done later after classification has been made with the main article namedpace, by collecting interwikis statistics on the \"category:\" namespace (for the top-100 most-wanted categories): note that statistics on locallinksto categories is a non-sense as the level of detail will be high in wikis with well structured categories, but the corresponding level of local links will be realtively low in those wikis).\n: Such statistical lists can then initiate new maintenance projects in all wikis, and this will give very interesting hints to contributors about where to put their efforts (creation, translation, organization, ...). It will also help solving local conflicts by looking at what has been done in other more local wikis (where there will be more experts in some cultural domains, and probably more external references). [[:fr:Utilisateur:Verdy_p|Verdy_p]], 22:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC).\n:: How about taking out the countries category altogether and leaving just the note saying that any wikipedia edition should eventually have an article about all the 200+ independent countries in the world. That is, I believe, how it was done originally. The list as a whole is still too long and could do with more cuts. I agree that it would be impossible to create an unbiased list of 30-40 countries that are recommended for any wikipedia edition to have.

Still, the list can be pretty wide and it might not be a bad idea.

E.g. in the section on specific religions we have, in addition to the names of major world religions, many lists of founders, holy books, sacred sites etc. Shouldn't we simply assume that once the article on the religion itself is created somewhere in the wikiverse, in all likelihood, the rest will follow naturally? Anyway, it seems obvious to me that this list is getting too long which IMHO reduces its usefulness for new/small wikipedias who would otherwise put it to good use (e.g. to contrast particularist/national/cultural bias). I therefore suggest that suggestions of new additions should always be accompanied with suggestions of an equal amount of deletions. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 11:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)\n::I agree with your concerns, the list would be more useful with only 1000 articles.

It seems that it is the biographies section (because it's at the top?) and the countries/cities section that are most in danger of spurious edits/additions that grow the list out of proportion. It has to be kept in mind that this is not a list of \"most important topics in wikipedia\" but simply a useful tool for smaller wikipedias to use. I therefore suggest the following:\n* For an addition to the list to be kept it has to be matched with a deletion\n* The biographies section and the geography section should be moved to the bottom of the list\n:::::: I made some extensive cuts to the list and removed some 100 entries from it - all very worthy topics. I believe this was necessary to get the list down to 1000 entries. It is now 1021 entries long, according to my count. I do think that the rule of one deleted entry per added entry should be used to keep the list from becoming bloated out of proportion, which is what prompted these cuts in the first place. The idea of someone adding to the list and someone else having to do the cutting does not seem fair. Also, adding an entry becomes more of a difficult decision if you also have to remove something else instead, thus discouraging spurious additions. If someone thinks I am being too radical and thinks this list would also be useful at, say 1300 or 1500 entries, I believe that should be discussed here before it is allowed to happen. Anyway, some limit is necessary, IMHO, to keep this list useful for small wikipedias, which is its purpose - again - not to be a list of everybody's idea of \"the most important topics in the world\". --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 22:40, 7 January 2007 (UTC)\n::::::: It is now '''exactly''' 1000 entries long. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 23:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n== The Quechua Test ==\n\nI was diverted to this page from checking on on Wikipedia in Quechua. The Quechua are a group descended from the Incas and now living in the highlands of the Andes from Colombia to Argentina.\n\nSo, I am looking at the list from a Quechua perspective, and considering the making of the Quechua Wikipedia. Things I notice:\n\n1: as mentioned, a very strong anglo-saxon bias\n2: a lack of certain key articles that someone Quechua might consider of importance to the World: the Inca Empire, the Spanish Conquest of the Americas, etc\n\nNow, certain topics are clearly key to everyone. Such \"World-key\" items might include:\n\nPeople:\nGeorge W Bush\n\nHistory:\nNazi Germany\n\nGeography:\nOcean\n\nSociety:\nLaw\n\netc.\n\nOthers might be of particularly Quechua interest, and would be added to the Quechua Wikipedia naturally in time: details of countries and provinces in the Quechua zone, Tupac Amaru, Quechua literary figures, etc. But, many of the topics in this list of 1000 seem of little relevance; I wonder how many people would want to read about the plasma state of matter or the Thirty Years War in Quechua.\n\nSo I propose: The Quechua Test\n\nTo have a place on this list, every topic should be of interest and importance to a Quechua speaker. By a Quechua, I mean perhaps \"someone you guys don't know much about\". It could be an actual Quechua in Bolivia or someone speaking a minor language anywhere else in the world. So, here's a profile of our \"Quechua\":\n\n1: minor languages are either spoken by people who are also (perhaps more) fluent in a major language (e.g. Welsh and English) or by people who are not. I propose that this list be catered more toward the latter category: for them, their wikipedia is a necessity for access to information rather than an extravagance.\n\n2: these peoples will generally lack access to many things we take for granted. There are very few websites in Quechua apart from the Quechua Wikipedia. Most major computer programs are not available in Quechua translations, for instance, so the relevance of specific articles on many computer languages is of less relevance as readers will be unable to learn how to use them.\n\n3: education is often at a lower level for monolingual speakers of minority languages, so we should include well-written articles on what might be considered basic topics in English Wikipedia.\n\n\nThis will give us a core list more suited to the use intended: this is not supposed to be a list of the most important articles in English Wikipedia, but rather one of the most necessary articles in a minority language. I am in favor of a list of much fewer than 1000 articles, perhaps 200 to make the project of creating them less daunting to a small group of bilingual wikipedians with access to the relevant information. I also suggest the creation of stripped down pages on these topics, edited in English with the aim of an easily translatable but informative piece.\n\nAs a final suggestion, perhaps we could include \"floating\" entries -- ones that are different depending on what language it is, e.g:\n\nThe Presidents of countries where this language is spoken\nDiseases most common to speakers of this language\nCultures of groups adjacent to that of this language\n\nor we could assume that those will be created naturally anyway.\n\n:Interesting thoughts.

This should be done with all other languages, but always respecting the limits.\n\nI'll wait for comments. If no one objects I may change the list. Cheers, --[[User:Ecelan|Ecelan]] 12:30, 19 December 2006 (UTC)\n:Interesting thoughts. But I think it might be better (but more difficult) to look at the notability of the authors in different part of the world, than to strictly go for a certain number of authors from each language. An approach I would like is to try to find out ''Which Asian authors are known in America?'' and ''Which African authors are known in China?'' and similar questions. However feel free to make the adjustments you think is good, then we'll see if someone change it. --[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] 11:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)\n::I think that the usefulness of lists like this lies not least in it trying actively to contrast systematic cultural bias. Quotas like you suggest are one (highly controversial) way of doing so. However, you already seem to introduce bias by your premises: What is the definition of a \"major language\" for example? Or a \"big literature\"? Why should novels, poetry and plays be selected over all other forms of verbal expression (i.e. folklore, short stories)? The main point is that we have only so much space on a list of \"articles all wikipedias should have\" that should (at least in principle) be limited to a 1000 articles to be practical. The way you suggest would inevitably either come up with way too many candidates, or be so limited as to be susceptible to systematic bias anyway. It's basically like this: pick those that in your opinion constitute the world's top three novelists out of all the novelists in the world... Such a short list will always be susceptible to someone's perception of bias. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 21:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::First of all, thanks for anwering.\n:::In a list like this, where you have the ''best of'' anything, unless you have objective means of measuring, you will always have a subjective list and thus a bias. I think we can all agree on that. The point is to try to make that bias as small as possible. Right now, 29 of 95 (about 30%) writers listed use English; 1 of 95 use Chinese. Chinese has a literature that is 2500 years old and 900 million speakers. I think we can do better than that.\n:::Boivie, the idea you propose still has a big bias in favor of western culture and mainly English speaking literature. Ask the people around you and you will see just how few know anything about Persian, Thai or Hindi literature. With that method, the first author on the list would be J. K. Rowling, the second Tolkien and the third Dan Brown. I'm not saying these should not go in the list, but I'd prefer Shakespeare any day. \n:::The list I have proposed tries to combine the bias of a subjective list with some ''rules'' that would ''objecivize'' it a little bit. We would do what Akigka says (''world's top three novelists''), but instead ''the \u00d8/two/three best writers of the X language'' and we just take the most important languages.\n:::Of course we'll still have to discuss what language goes where and what writers should be listed. To decide which literatures are big shouldn't really be that difficult. Let's just say: several centuries of existence, a certain number of writers, number of speakers, a (modern) publishing industry with X titles per year, etc. all these should be objective criteria. We can adjust these criteria so that we get the numbers we need. For \"major languages\" we just have to take the 5 (or less) most spoken, but I would at least take Chinese and English. \n:::Personally I really would have flexible criteria on what goes where (and not so many rules) and combine them with common sense, but one way or the other, you would always have a frame to keep you grounded.\n:::Cheers, --[[User:Ecelan|Ecelan]] 19:25, 21 December 2006 (UTC)\n::::I think the method you propose to reform the list of writers is valid however and think you should go ahead and make those changes you think are justified on that basis. I would first, however, like to go over the list and simply reduce it to ca 50 entries. We need to cut this list by some 300 entries to keep it 1000 entries long. What worries me most is that it seems to grow by undiscussed, anonymous and seemingly spurious additions. This severely limits its usefulness, which I think is important to consider. --[[User:Akigka|Akigka]] 12:21, 22 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nI have done my best. (I still think we should take some western authors out of the list and add some south and central asian ones, but I know too little about it to do it myself.)

Some ideas...\n\n[[en:Shen Kuo]] seems to be the most impressive Song-era Chinese scientist.<br/ >\n[[en:Brahmagupta]] was an Indian astronomer-mathematician.<br/ >\n[[en:Aryabhata]] was another Indian  astronomer-mathematician.<br/ >\n[[en:Panini]] was a grammarian and linguist, but seems to be the greatest one from ancient times.  His name comes up again and again in histories of India and Indian philosophy.  He standardized Sanskrit and philosophized via language.  Perhaps he should be put on one of these lists.  He could replace [[en:Chanakya]] for example among the thinkers.\n\nI'd pick Brahmagupta, already present in 27 Wikipedias, as a replacement for Fibonacci, who was merely a transmitter of ideas from the East.  Fibonacci himself refers to the \"method of the Indians\" - so why place him over those he imitated?  Or Aryabhata would work on the scientists list as well.  Both influenced deeply later Arabic and European math and science.  Panini could replace Chanakya among the social scientists.  What do you think?  [[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 23:31, 4 January 2010 (UTC)\n\n:I cannot claim to be an exert on this topic but your argument to replace Fibonnacci with Brahmagupta seems strong. Here's the [[/Archives/2009#Serious Eurocentrism - and I can begin to fix it|discussion]] about including Chanakya for reference. I thought we was a pioneer for accounting.

This medieval/early modern list is heavily European, although Europe was not yet dominant in the world, particularly not in the middle ages when it was a decidedly weak region.  A full 11 of the 16 articles are about Europe!  In addition, the [[en:Mughal Empire]] of India certainly belongs on the list as one of the major early modern empires (and the sole representative of India on the list).  Yes, Akbar is already listed as a major leader, but so are plenty of leaders whose states or events appear elsewhere.\n\nI think we should consider adding [[en:Mamluk]].  This was a very important Muslim sultanate and military phenomenon generally (see article).  The phenomenon as a whole is certainly more important than [[en:Saladin]], although the latter's fame means that I still might not want to remove him.  Saladin and Mamluk are both medieval-era aspects of the Arab world...\n\nWith regard to Africa, perhaps [[en:Voodou]] could be added as well.  I'd have to consider what to remove though.\n\nThat's all for now. [[User:Aghniyya|Aghniyya]] 06:32, 6 January 2010 (UTC)\n\n:[[en:Voodoo]] was in the list a while back but it was removed. It was a disamb page for [[en:Haitian Vodou]], [[en:Louisiana Voodoo]] and [[en:West African Vodun]].

Fire perhaps refers more to the visible flame. \n\nSecond, I think it would be nice if the fuels [[en:Petroleum]], [[en:Coal]] and [[en:Biofuel]] would be included (I think they have been at some point). Petroleum and coal are obviously very important while biofuels are the primary fuels in the developing world. I do not exactly know what to remove though. I am a bit sceptic about [[en:Steam engine]], it is only historically important, and there is already the article [[en:Industrial revolution]]. The simple machines, [[en:Lever]], [[en:Pulley]], [[en:Screw]] and [[en:Wheel]] are perhaps not so necessary either (wheel seems to be the most important). [[en:Nanotechnology]] is also a very small field of engineering and hardly deserves a slot. --[[User:Ion-5|Ion-5]] 06:33, 14 April 2010 (UTC)\n\n:I propose to remove [[en:Lever]], [[en:Pulley]] and add [[en:Machine]], [[en:Robot]]. --[[User:Igrek|Igrek]] 08:59, 14 April 2010 (UTC)\n\n::I support that proposal.

It is also a larger English article since with combustion it covers simply the chemical formulas. Covering \"flame\" and \"heat\" is seems important so cannot agree with that change.\n\n:We already have [[en:Fossil fuel]] which cover petroleum and coal. But I support [[en:Petroleum]] and [[en:Biofuel]] in the list. I think you have to draw the line somewhere so don't think we need \"coal\".\n\n:I have always thought the simple machines need to go. So, I support the change from \"lever\" or \"pulley\" to \"robot\". But the \"machine\" article in en.wp looks more like a disamb page than an article.

They could be replaced by [[en:Petroleum]], [[en:Coal]], [[en:Biofuel]] and [[en:Windpower]] ([[en:Nuclear power]] is already included elsewhere, and if the line has to be drawn somewhere, [[en:Natural gas]] can be left out). Anyway, having both the fuels and their umbrella terms is too much. If I could choose what is more important in an encyclopedia, I think the individual fuels would be more important. Then only two other articles have to be removed, and I think one could be [[en:Nanotechnology]] and the other one of the simple machines. Not sure I agree with removing the computer or electrical terms though.\n\n:::I agree that [[en:Machine]] should be included! A very basic term. The fact that the english articles is short is no reason - it would be a signal to english wikipedia that it needs to be improved. English wikipedia is in general not so good on technology, compared to for example German wikipedia. [[en:Rocket]] and [[en:Laser]] does not strike me as hughely important though.\n\n:::Concerning fire and combustion - I think combustion ''is'' the broader term, which includes everything about fire - ignition, fuel, conditions, fire, flame, glowing, char, ash, heat and so on. Just because it is a \"chemical process\" doesn't mean it's only about chemistry, \"chemical process\" is a very broad term. English wikipedia has indeed chosen to include more content in the article [[en:Fire]] but I think this is erronous, the term \"fire\" refers more to the actual flame rather than the whole process. Just because English wikipedia has it wrong I dont think everyone else should follow. --[[User:Ion-5|Ion-5]] 06:18, 16 April 2010 (UTC)\n::::I agree with the argument about [[en:Machine]].

That's why you will find relatively small countries like [[Israel]], relatively secondary languages as [[Esperanto]] and works of art which are not so popular as many others, but are maybe relevant as the most outstanding work of art of that kind or from that geographical area (yes, although \"hey, but we lack more important ones!\"). --[[User:WinstonSmith|WinstonSmith]] 08:25, 7 May 2010 (UTC)\n\n== Anime vs Bollywood/Hollywood/ ==\n\nIn 2009 [[Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2009#Replacement_suggestions|George Lucas was replaced by anime]].

This is an open Wiki system and not a conventional publisher, and you can do anything as long as it makes sense and follows certain rules of inclusion (which an expanded list certainly does). So just stop asking and do it. You can even make both of them - 2000 and 10,000 articles.

Racehorses and magicians are just a symptoms of little filtering or applying of criteria. How about instead of having an actual list of \"articles\" we have a list of \"article sets\" like \"every element in periodic table\",  \"every person who won a nobel peace prize\", \"every movie that won Oscar for best picture or best foreign film\", \"every country represented in UN\", \"every musical instrument in standard orchestra\", etc. That way the list wouldn't be so long  and you can see the criteria.

I would support taking out UAE and adding Dubai, as we more frequently hear about the latter than the former; in fact, countless people mistake Dubai as a ''country'' than realising that its actually a city in a country. That goes to show how notable the topic is on itself. If the UAE were to be replaced as the result of Dubai's inclusion, I would suggest adding Qatar - another resource rich state, which according to its main article, is also the \"second highest per-capita income country\" in the world.

Possible reasons:\n*Another oil (and gas) rich state; adding in place of UAE would be like a neutraliser. Would also meet the argument of RekishiEJ, who said that UAE, a state rich in oil is critically important. For record, Qatar, apart from being rich in oil, additionally has the third-largest gas reserves in the world. I would have nominated Bahrain too, another Mid-East country rich in its resources, although am advocating Qatar as it is more larger and important. \n*As pointed out, Qatar is also the second (or first) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita highest per-capita income country] in the world. As said in the main article, \"Oil and gas have made Qatar the second highest per-capita income country \u2013 following Liechtenstein \u2013 and one of the world's fastest growing.\"   \n*A small but important gulf state in its own right, Qatar is also regarded by many economists as an 'emerging Dubai.' Many important organisations such as the international news network [[en:Al Jazeera|Al Jazeera]] are Qatari. \n*Qatar Airways is ranked among the top ten in the world and its Economy Class was named best in the world in 2009.\n*Qatar's capital city, [[en:Doha|Doha]], is an important regional economic center, and has been the center of important occasions such as the 2006 Asian Games, (the Asian Games are Asia's Olympic-style sporting event).\n*Speaking in terms of sports, Qatar has made bids for events such as the 2016 Olympics and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.      \nThe conclusion is that Qatar emulates the UAE in many ways as an important gulf state. Don't get me wrong - I am displaying no special bias or favouritism towards Middle East topics (neither do I come from there) but on an independent look, I give this proposal second-thought and think that it would be a good candidate - and we could perhaps take out Kinshasa. [[Special:Contributions/124.185.55.231|124.185.55.231]] 05:57, 21 September 2010 (UTC)\n:A very good proposal.

Better not to change.\n\nAs for Africa, Nile and Congo River are undoubtedly worthy of the place. But Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria, and Niger River? I'm still doubting.\n\nAs for Europe, Rhine is the shortest river in the whole list (111th in the world and 4th in Europe). But Rhine is quite important. I prefer not to remove it. Baltic Sea and North Sea, maybe we can remove one of them. No other single-continent seas are in the list.\n\nAs for Asia, maybe we can remove Dead Sea. It is a place of interest, but perhaps not a place of as much importance. Then maybe Ganges. It is quite important, but there are so many bigger Asian rivers that are not on the list, such as Mekong River, Amur River, and Euphrates.\n\nSo, my vote is Yellow River is definitely in, and one of the European seas or African lakes or Asian small waters is out. :) --[[User:BettyJJ|BettyJJ]] 19:54, 29 October 2010 (UTC)\n: I would replace Dead Sea.

[[User:Macdonald-Ross|Macdonald-Ross]] 05:19, 29 July 2010 (UTC)\n\n== add Portuguese language ==\nIn the list so far, there are languages with very few speakers such as Greek and Hebrew, languages spoken in only one country like Japanese, languages with a medium to large amount of speakers but limited prestige and few second language learners like Bengali, Tamil and Turkish, the dead ones and the promoted ones such as Latin, Sanskrit and Esperanto and then there are those others that form what I would call a certain, if heterogeneous standard. With its number of total speakers, its number of foreign learners and its history/literature I consider Portuguese definitely to belong to the latter group. - 13:57, 12 August 2010 (UTC)\n:Yes, you're right. The langauge selection is based on more than just number of speakers. See the [[Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2009#en:Portuguese_Language|discussion in 2009]]. Which language would you remove? --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 16:15, 12 August 2010 (UTC)\n::Just went through the thread, thanks for linking. One criterion that also seems to be involved, is something one may call \"not standing in the shadow\" of another big language which may be a point of not considering Cantonese which in its home country also represents less than 10%. The same applies to Tamil and besides, from India two languages are already included. So it may make sense to either go for that one or for Sanskrit. Sanskrit does in my eyes however stand out more due to its historic role compared to Tamil that I see as not being distinguished over Telugu, Gujarati or Marathi. - 20:42, 12 August 2010 (UTC)\n:::Bengali, Hindi, and Sanskrit overlap somewhat, as all three are members of the Indo-Aryan sub-subfamily of the Indo-Iranian subfamily of the Indo-European family, and all three are therefore cousins of numerous European languages already on the list; Tamil provides contrast, as it's a member of the Dravidian family, unrelated to any of the preceding. In that sense, it doesn't \"stand in the shadow\" of these Indian & European examples, whereas Portuguese does. [[Special:Contributions/71.178.62.245|71.178.62.245]] 02:07, 16 August 2010 (UTC)\n::::A good friend of mine's native language is Kannada yet he wouldn't argue that Telugu is not Dravidian, apart from its  being listed as lingua franca as opposed to Tamil (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca). For me the argumentative base for instance is not just 1. prestige (look at how many Noble Prize Winners in Literature were Polish or Italian), 2. the number of books published (take a look at page 9 of www.britishcouncil.org/learning-elt-future.pdf and at page 12, too to understand my reasoning) or 3. the simple fact that Portuguese is spoken in each of the four highly populated continents (also look at Dutch and its spread to Suriname, to South Africa and to Indonesia which also did not make it to the list, also cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-widely_spoken_languages_%28by_number_of_countries%29).      I didn't mean to offend anybody and targeted with the point about the shadow only the ratio (of Tamil) to Hindi; you seem to overgeneralize there. Hindi does work as a lingua franca (apart from Tamil being a fraction of Sinhala in terms of  speaker numbers in Sri Lanka) and a big one, too.      With your arguments, Swahili or Bahasa Indonesia (other lingua francas that are not Indo-European) would make much more sense and I have a lot of respect for them (numbers of second language speakers appear to be over five times higher than native speakers and anybody can learn them with Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone and for free via the FSI which also applies to other languages that do not make it to this \"distinguished list of twenty\" such as Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog which apart from being listed in all three language learning programs and apart from their unrelatedness to the Indoeuropean language family are, again, all national languages and not the third, fourth or fifth one \"at home\").       The reason why I didn't nominate one of them was that by learning Portuguese one can have a more significant and immediate global impact as it is spoken in many international organizations such as Mercosur, FIFA, the General Conference of UNESCO, SADC, IADB, ACTO, AU, UNASUR (to give a brief excerpt) and its role is most likely to continue to increase over the coming decades.

Maybe they should be swapped, or [[en:Nazism|Nazism]] instead of [[en:Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany]]. --[[User:Renessaince|Renessaince]] 11:04, 2 January 2011 (UTC)\n\n:In my opinion, you have misinterpreted international fame (or infamy, whatever) for global importance. Not even current American leaders are in the list, so there's no rationale to include Lukashenka, who is far less important, globally. As for Nazism, I remember that it has been discussed before.

The current subject of en:Sex is the sex as a property of organisms and this isn't a biological process (as says the section in the list). Furthermore the English article is just a patchwork of content taken from other articles - mostly from en:Sexual reproduction. en:Sexual reproduction is the general subject that would naturally fit in the Biological processes section. --[[User:Nk|Nk]] 19:52, 3 February 2011 (UTC)\n\n:You're right \"Sex\" probably doesn't belong under \"Reproduction\" or \"Biological processes\" with the way it written. It is basically is an overview article of anything \"Sexual\". Replacing it with \"Sexual reproduction\" makes things more redundant since we already have [[en:Reproduction]]. IMO, unless there is some language translation problem or we do a multiple article swap it best the way it is. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 05:45, 8 February 2011 (UTC)\n\n== [[en:Honesty]] ==\n\nI think honesty is a very important thing in the human society.

This section is, in my opinion, grossly underrepresented in the current list. It becomes especially evident if you compare it to the other natural sciences like Physics, Chemistry and especially Biology.

Where are you from Pince Kassad to say that even is not an important country? I would say is more important than yours. We already have small numbers of articles about countries.

Some important european cities are not in the list like [[en:Barcelona]] or [[en:Milan]] that are VERY important cities and we have many african and other continent cities that doesn't have any importance. What's the importance of [[en:Kinshasa]], what companies are located there? Removing [[en:Poland]] and leaving [[en:Algeria]] is also crazy. What's the importance of Algeria? And what about [[en:Cuba]]? I suggested before to be replaced by [[en:Colombia]] as Colombia is much bigger and important than Cuba. --[[User:Santista1982|Santista1982]] 15:57, 1 April 2011 (UTC)\n\n****Well Cuba is a very strong Latin American country and one of the last Socialist countries in the world, and the disputes with the United States are what makes this country so significant to the world. But I agree [[en:Algeria]] seems useless.<br>As for cities, [[en:Kinshasa]] seems like a bad choice, it should be removed and replaced with a non-city topic. A lot of cities should be removed actually, many have no importance beyond the country they belong to (like [[en:Bogot\u00e1]], [[en:Jakarta]], [[en:Kolkata]], etc.) If you want this, it's worth it to plan out a table, like I did with some of my suggestions. -- [[User:Prince Kassad|Prince Kassad]] 16:09, 1 April 2011 (UTC)\n\n== Century ==\nMy next point is [[en:Century]]. A century is just one hundred years - there's nothing that can really be said about this time span (check out the interwikis), and it's not even used in the whole world (in East Asia, for example, the century is almost unknown). Therefore, I propose to replace it with [[en:Logarithm]], another basic concepts of mathematics.

My guess is many foreign Wikipedias just translated that. If we look at de:, it describes various applications of probability in philosophy (as well as a short heading on the probability theory), and at the end it is even categorized into the philosophy category. It would need a new discussion, as adding Probability breaks section balance. -- [[User:Prince Kassad|Prince Kassad]] 08:40, 26 March 2011 (UTC)\n\n:::::In any case, probability is a more crucial concept than its mathematical description. It would be rather redundant to have them both in this list, regardless of where we discuss it.

The city have no global importance at all, [[en:Santiago]] is much more important. The same about [[en:Afganisthan]], what this country produces? MAybe is the poorest place in the world, their agriculture is almost nothing, their production is almost nothing, you can't comprare with [[en:Colombia]] that have bigger population, bigger territory and bigger importance than [[en:Afganisthan]]. I think these are just some of changes that the list should be do, and later remove [[en:Singapore]], a small country with small population that despite that is in the list. --[[User:Santista1982|Santista1982]] 16:28, 1 April 2011 (UTC)\n:You want to remove Kinshasa and Afghanistan because they doesn't have any global importance (but they are large) and you want to remove Singapore because it isn't large (but is globally important). It seems to pass your criteria to be included Santiago needs to be large and have global importance but you didn't include any statistics in your argument for us to compare.\n:We did have Colombia in the list at some point (look in the archives) but since we had Venezuela, it was removed to be more balanced. Also, we have Bogota so it seemed fair at the time to have Venezuela instead of Colombia. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 17:50, 1 April 2011 (UTC)\n::Yes, Colombia should probably be in there but we already have quite a lot of Latin American countries so this isn't quite easy.

On the other hand, Taiwan is a quite significant country. -- [[User:Prince Kassad|Prince Kassad]] 08:35, 5 April 2011 (UTC)\n: And what makes Taiwan more significant than e.g. Philippines? Maybe it's better to agree on a hard criteria about countries otherwise this discussion will start again every couple of months.\n: Just as a test I tried to make an union of the top 20 countries by GDP, area and population.

It makes no sense to have Mt. Everest as the only individual mountain in the list, when there are arguably several others that are at least as important. However, I don't think we should add [[en:Salt]] because there's already [[en:Salt (chemistry)]], and they're quite similar.

Group theory is a specific discipline within abstract algebra. An article on group theory is necessarily specialized. The essence of group theory, however, is symmetry: Groups (in the mathematical sense) were originally discovered as symmetry groups, and many of their most important applications can still be understood directly as the presence of symmetry in some sort of mathematical object.\n# Add logarithm.  This is of great historical and practical interest.  Logarithms are used every day for measurements of sound, power, earthquakes, and a wide variety of other natural phenomena.\n# Remove Axiom.  This has a lot of overlap with mathematical proof, truth, and logic, all of which are already on the list.\n# Mathematical analysis is replaced by differential and integral calculus. This effectively undoes a change made last year (see [[Talk:List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Archives/2010#Replace_Calculus_with_Mathematical_analysis|this discussion]]), as on the English Wikipedia, differential and integral calculus is a redirect to calculus.  The problem with the outcome of that discussion is that in English, \"mathematical analysis\" refers to a broad area within mathematics, encompassing not only differential and integral calculus, but also aspects of Fourier theory, number theory, and differential geometry.  The list should link to the English article entitled \"calculus\", but to avoid confusion, the link should be titled \"differential and integral calculus\" since that refers unambiguously to the subject we are attempting to list.  (In many languages the name of this subject translates as \"infinitesimal calculus\", which would also be acceptable, but on the English Wikipedia, that article is currently about some historical aspects of calculus.)\n# Remove numerical analysis.  Numerical analysis is about how to make accurate computations on computers. It's a specialized field which most people have no contact with; I'm a professional mathematician and I have no contact with it.\n# Replace triangle, circle and square with angle, area, and Pythagorean theorem. The list is weighted heavily in favor of geometric shapes. Geometric shapes are a basic topic in geometry, but each geometric shape is not a new concept; they're all examples of the particular concept of shape. Angle and area are two fundamental concepts that don't appear anywhere on the list, and the Pythagorean theorem might be the most important theorem ever; it is at the heart of how we measure distance in the real world, and it is probably the only theorem that a layman might recall.\n# Replace number theory by prime number.  Number theory is a broad field of study with a tremendous range of interesting but not always easy to understand topics.  When possible, I would prefer that the list contain more specific topics. Prime numbers are just that kind of topic: They can be approached using simple examples that anyone can grasp, and they are at the heart of number theory.\n# Replace complex number by inequality.  Inequalities are a part of everyone's life: \"This pear costs more than that apple\", \"That will take an hour, but I only have twenty minutes\", \"This building is taller than that one\", etc.  Complex numbers are everywhere in physics and mathematics, but they don't connect to people's lives in the same way.\n# Add standard deviation.  This is one of the most important topics in statistics; it's consistently the #2 viewed article on the English Wikipedia (after Einstein, who was actually a physicist).  Furthermore, it's also a bridge to other aspects of higher math: The standard deviation is actually an L<sup>2</sup> norm (see [[en:Lp space]]), and L<sup>2</sup> norms also represent important concepts like distance and energy.\n\nThere are many other articles that I would love to include but which I am not sure how to make space for (such as [[en:Pascal's triangle]], [[en:Fibonacci number]], [[en:G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]], [[en:Russell's paradox]], [[en:Cantor's diagonal argument]], [[en:Wave]] (maybe the physics list needs that one?), and [[en:M\u00f6bius strip]]).\n\nComments? [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 13:26, 18 May 2011 (UTC)\n:Looks like reasonable and well motivated changes. I noticed however that [[:en:Differential and integral calculus]] is redirected to Calculus, and that Calculus have quite few interwiki links. [[User:Boivie|Boivie]] 20:07, 19 May 2011 (UTC)\n::Unfortunately, many of those interwiki links are wrong. The word \"calculus\" in English usually means \"Differential and integral calculus\". This is not true in other languages. In other languages \"calculus\" is more like [[:en:Calculus (disambiguation)]]. Usually the correct analog of the English \"calculus\" is named \"Differential and integral calculus\" or \"Infinitesimal calculus\". [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 12:27, 20 May 2011 (UTC)\n::Following up on myself, I've fixed as many of the interlingual links as I can. Of the languages linked from [[en:Calculus]] and [[en:Infinitesimal calculus]], I attempted to tally how many articles used each of the possible terms.  \"Calculus\" was used by 11 (bs, en, ga, io, id, jv, ms, pt, sco, ss, tr), \"mathematical analysis\" by 1 (an), \"infinitesimal calculus\" by 15 (an, ca, da, de, es, eo, fr, gl, hr, it, la, pt, sl, sr, sv), \"differential and integral calculus\" by 5 (fr, lt, pt, sk, fi), there were a whole bunch that I couldn't read at all (am, ar, zh-min-nan, bn, el, fa, gan, he, ko, hi, is, ml, mr, ja, pl, si, ta, th, ur, zh-yue, zh), and there were two that I couldn't read but my best guess is that the interlanguage link points to the wrong article (qu (see [[:en:Quechua language]]) and war (see [[:en:Waray-Waray language]])). The count appears to be won by \"infinitesimal calculus\", which has all the major European languages.  (However, someone actually fluent in all those languages would probably be able to make a better count.)\n::I think the right thing to do is to merge [[:en:Infinitesimal calculus]] into [[:en:Calculus]], and then include \"Infinitesimal calculus\" on the list. [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 03:14, 21 May 2011 (UTC)\n: I'm OK with most of the changes except:\n: 5. See [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Archives/2010#Replace Calculus with Mathematical analysis]]. I don't see a reason to exclude \"aspects of Fourier theory, number theory, and differential geometry\".\n: 6. Numerical analysis is of great practical importance. If it crates a problem for a professional mathematician we can move it to Engineering section. :)\n: 8. See [[#Replace number sets]] - general theory should be more important than one of its subjects.\n: 9. Complex number could be replaced but I think that Inequality would be highly redundant with Equation.\n:[[User:Nk|Nk]] 17:38, 24 May 2011 (UTC)\n::5. I don't believe the argument put forward in that thread. \"Mathematical analysis\" is a huge, huge field, but its original basis and most important tools are derivatives and integrals. The cornerstone of harmonic analysis is the [[:en:Fourier transform]], which is an integral; harmonic analysis considers more general objects such as [[:en:integral transform]]s, but these too are defined by integrals. The earliest use of analysis in number theory was [[:en:Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], which is an application of the Fourier transform (an integral). Analysis is everywhere in differential geometry because integrals and derivatives are everywhere in differential geometry. For example, the [[:en:Isoperimetric inequality]] is at heart a statement about integrals. [[:en:Hodge theory]] is a very powerful relation between shape and derivatives. Without derivatives and integrals, mathematical analysis would not exist.\n::6. If you can find an engineering topic to get rid of, then we can replace that by numerical analysis. It would be better there, because it's an obscure, tiny corner of mathematics. (Also, as far as I can tell, about half of numerical analysis is how to approximate integrals. So we can't include numerical analysis unless we include calculus. :-)\n::8. I disagree here, too. The study of prime numbers is not merely one subject among many in number theory. Primes are central to number theory in a way that nothing else is. Number-theoretic questions, even ones that appear to have nothing to do with prime numbers, are often solved by studying primes. For example, a large part of number theory is studying [[:en:Diophantine equation]]s. \"Solving a Diophantine equation\" means finding all the possible integer solutions to that equation. [[:en:Fermat's Last Theorem]] is an example of this kind of problem, and solving it is equivalent to solving it when the exponent is prime. In fact, Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem required studying the behavior of elliptic curves modulo primes. Prime numbers hold a special place in number theory in the same way that integrals and derivatives hold a special place in mathematical analysis.\n::9. I disagree. Compare [[:en:Equation]] (which is quite short) to [[:en:Inequality]] (which is long and detailed). There is a lot to say about inequalities.\n::Of course, all the articles currently on the list are interesting, too. I would prefer to not remove any articles from the math section, but I do not think that is practical. [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 20:57, 25 May 2011 (UTC)\n:::Nk, I saw from your revert that you still disagree with my changes.  I was hoping that you would post a response to me, but so far you haven't.  I am particularly concerned at the loss of [[:en:Inequality]].  Mathematical analysis and numerical analysis cannot be understood without inequalities, and there are many topics in geometry, number theory, and statistics that depend on inequalities.  If the list is supposed to cover \"general theory\" as you said above, then I think it should cover the very general and very practical topic of inequalities.  I still believe that Inequality should replace Complex number. [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 12:55, 5 June 2011 (UTC)\n:::: I'm sorry for the rather long delay but I don't follow that discussion very closely. As I said before from my point of view the content of Inequality and Equation should be overlapping to a great extent. Currently en:Inequality is longer than en:Equation but if you look inside you can see that most of the content could be moved to the other article with small changes (properties, examples, etc.). I can't say which one is more important, I'm just saying that we don't need both articles together in the list. --[[User:Nk|Nk]] 16:37, 3 July 2011 (UTC)\n\n Ozob did the change [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have&action=historysubmit&diff=2616071&oldid=2560819 diff] --[[User:Akkakk|Akkakk]] 23:11, 30 May 2011 (UTC)\n:[[:en:Differential and integral calculus]] is a redirect to [[:en:Calculus]]. and please update [[Template:Top1000 recent changes]]. --[[User:Akkakk|Akkakk]] 23:11, 30 May 2011 (UTC)\n\n: Nice. And what shall we do? Calculus in Ukrainian is a very useful practical skill to count to 10, 100, 1000 or more (I never tried). We can't point Differential and integral calculus to a redirect. Perhaps, the result will be pointing ukrainian Mathematical analysys to your Calculus. You changed the topic with a fair competition to something weird. [[Special:Contributions/93.73.24.135|93.73.24.135]] 18:59, 2 June 2011 (UTC)\n\n::I am not sure what you are saying here. Are you saying that because [[:en:Differential and integral calculus]] is a redirect to [[:en:Calculus]] on the English Wikipedia, it should also be a redirect on the Ukranian Wikipedia? I do not think it should be. Most languages call this subject \"Infinitesimal calculus\". In English it is usually called \"Calculus\". I made it a redirect above so that it would not be confused with other meanings of \"calculus\". [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 21:30, 2 June 2011 (UTC)\n::: Whatever. This is a funny competition. You set the rules, we dance. I just want to note that it is called ''''articles every Wikipedia should have'''. Every language chapter of the Wikipedia should have an article on derivative, integral, sequence, series or limit. Likewise, every chapter of Wikipedia should have an article on mathematical analysis, while the article on calculus is not really necessary or pressing. What is calculus? This is a traditional English term for mathanalysis. We respect traditions. What is differential and integral calculus? It is mathematical analysis. Neither theory of differential equations or differential geometry belong to mathematical analysis. They are related but separate fields of mathematics. Fourier series do belong to the mathematical analysis as a specific case of series.  --[[Special:Contributions/93.73.24.135|93.73.24.135]] 03:48, 3 June 2011 (UTC)\n::::In my experience, in the English language and in professional mathematics more widely, \"calculus\" and \"infinitesimal calculus\" refer to the study of derivatives and integrals. \"Mathematical analysis\" is a wider field which is based on derivatives and integrals. Because it is impossible to understand mathematical analysis without understanding infinitesimal calculus, I believe that \"infinitesimal calculus\" is a more important article. [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 11:14, 3 June 2011 (UTC)\n::::: Is it fair to impose English usage on others? 5 of the top 10 Wikipedias, Catalan, French, Italian, Russian and Ukrainian do not consider this distinction important at all. The article Calculus should not be in all Wikipedias. Guess what will happen to the end of the month? All interwiki from [[en:Mathematical analysis]] will gradually migrate to [[en:Calculus]]. The advantage you gained is for a month only. --[[Special:Contributions/93.73.24.135|93.73.24.135]] 14:02, 3 June 2011 (UTC)\n::::::I do not think that most of the interwiki links from [[en:Mathematical analysis]] should be moved to [[en:Calculus]].  They are articles about different topics.  I think that calculus is a more important article because mathematical analysis builds on calculus. [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 21:47, 4 June 2011 (UTC)\n\nI don't see the point in removing square or circle, all the basic shapes should be in the list, since they are very common concepts, above than others more specialized. We are talking about core articles--[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] 08:00, 3 June 2011 (UTC)\n:I would like to include them, but I think that angle and area are more fundamental. But if you can offer a reason why square and circle are more important, then I may reconsider. [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 11:14, 3 June 2011 (UTC)\nWell they are basic shapes, with an important symbolism besides maths. I can agree with angle but area it seems less important than any shape, it's a subordinate concept --[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] 14:59, 4 June 2011 (UTC)\n:I agree that there are important symbolic meanings of squares and circles (and triangles, too).  I would like to keep them in the list, but area is one of the basic kinds of measurements, and I can't imagine the list being complete without it.  If there were more room on the list I would keep them.  I think the rest of your argument would be more appropriate if it were applied to [[en:Shape]].  Area is common to all shapes, but no particular shape is important to the concept of area.  [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 21:47, 4 June 2011 (UTC)\n\nI know I'm coming late to this discussion, but I agree with Barcelona.  As the list stands, it is too technical.  Sure, calculus is an important concept, but the concept of a square, circle or other is more well-known.  I would remove differential equation (seems redundant to differential calculus) and add back circle or square.

I'm not sure we need articles about really ''basic'' concepts -- like circle, angle, area -- because anyone who's sophisticated and educated enough to be reading an encyclopedia probably already understands those.  I think it's more useful to have articles about the fundamental ideas of mathematics -- analysis (incl. derivatives, integrals, differential equations, dynamical systems), algebra (incl. number theory), foundations (incl. logic, set theory, category theory), geometry (incl. topology) -- rather than about elementary concepts that happen to have some mathematical content.  (But of the recent changes I do think [[:en:Symmetry]] is an excellent idea, and I expect to write the corresponding article for my \"home\" WP myself.) [[User:Amahoney|Amahoney]] 12:33, 20 June 2011 (UTC)\n:: I disagree, of course anyone who reads tihos know what is a triangle, but not perhaps all the formulas related, its symbols and history: this is an encyclopaedia not a dictionary. Think about students, for example, they should know about all the things I said before, we are talking about the core topics each language should have and that means that they are basic concepts--[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] 16:48, 30 June 2011 (UTC)\n\n:I suppose it depends on what your conception of a space-limited encyclopedia ought to be.  Should it start from the ground and ensure that all of its articles need no knowledge not contained elsewhere in the encyclopedia?  Or should it be the most important articles from a larger (possibly nonexistent) encyclopedia?  In practice it has to start in the middle, but where's that?  The middle depends on the encyclopedia's target audience.  I could have proposed a more technical list above (with for example [[:en:Measure (mathematics)]] in place of [[:en:Area]]), but even though that would be appropriate for a mathematical encyclopedia, I do not think it would be appropriate for a general audience encyclopedia.\n\n:I am not sure what principles should be used to determine the content of this page.  It makes me uneasy about the choice of articles on this page.  [[User:Ozob|Ozob]] 13:12, 20 June 2011 (UTC)\n\n== Basic geographical concepts ==\n\nI'm a bit surprised that, while there are many articles on specific geographical objects, articles on the related basic concepts are missing. There are several articles on individual lakes, but none on [[:en:lake|lake]], several on individual countries consisting solely of islands, but none on [[:en:island|island]]. Also, there's one on rain forest, but not on the more basic concept of [[:en:forest|forest]], one on city but not on [[:en:human settlement|settlement]] (and on [[:en:human migration|migration]], a major component of the ever-increasing importance of cities). I know that the last one is a bit hard to argue for, because city is probably much more often searched for, but as in other mentioned cases, I cannot imagine defining a city other than by \"large settlement\" (and it seems I'm [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Archives/2009#Town or city|not the only one doing so]]). Also, the non-settled lifestyle of [[:en:nomad|nomad]], a historically very important concept, isn't featured on the list. Interestingly, agriculture is on the list (and rightfully so), but not [[:en:hunting|hunting]]. On the other hand, there are articles on both sea and ocean, but isn't the difference between them only one of definition, just like the one between island and continent? I'm not even sure these differences exist in every language, especially the \"smaller\" ones this list is addressed to. I know, it's a long list of proposed additions and a small one of proposed removals, but generally, I would argue for less specific objects and more basic concepts to be featured on the list, even if the latter ones are a bit more searched for, because one of the most important tasks an encyclopedia should fulfil is defining, while explaining can only be the following step. --[[User:Axolotl|Axolotl]] 13:34, 3 June 2011 (UTC)\n: I agree with Axolot --[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] 10:07, 20 June 2011 (UTC)\n\n: I am not in favor of selecting general topics since we have the constraint of 1000 articles. The [[w:Sea|sea]] article is a good example why including them is not useful. They tend to be just a definition and a list of examples. The same would go for most basic geographic concepts. Also, I think we can assume a certain level of knowledge for people who are read Wikipedia. They are using a computer and the Internet after all. I am pretty sure the audience for these articles can understand an article on \"rain forest\" without beforehand reading \"forest\". I would just make the decision purely on importance. In that case \"rain forest\" is more relevant and important, IMHO. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 18:18, 27 June 2011 (UTC)\n:: I insist on the arguments above, you can say a lot about a sea, and knowledge everybody has is a very subjective issue: we are talking about the must articles--[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] 16:50, 30 June 2011 (UTC)\n\n::: Actually, in my opinion, \"sea\" is a good example of a problematic concept that would not be as suitable for inclusion here, because it doesn't have a precise definition. What is a sea? A body of saline water somewhat larger than a bay and somewhat smaller than an ocean where the name \"sea\" reflects traditional naming rather than size. You really cannot say much about that, other than list the examples. \"Island\" is almost the same. \"Lake\" is much better; sure, there's a couple in Central Asia bearing the name \"sea\", but those are about the only ones. I think we should keep this in mind when discussing changes. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 06:47, 1 July 2011 (UTC)\n:::PS: a city has a much more precise legislative and administrative definition in most (all?) countries than merely being a \"large settlement\". In many cases, it also has historical relevance. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 06:54, 1 July 2011 (UTC)\n\n::::Well, first, \"sea\" ''is'' included (even in bolt letters), and I had just argued why an article about it can also comprise enough information about \"ocean\" (at least for the standards of an encyclopedia of 1000 articles). So, while I am basically in favor of ''more'' articles on basic geographical concepts, this was the only example where I found an included one to be a bit too redundant. The way I see it, it's not supposed to be about \"a sea\", but \"the sea\" as an ecosystem, a waterway, a legal or political term (\"high seas\"), and so on. This comprises oceans, bays and other bodies of saline water of various size, though to different extents. So, if you're wondering why the English article on the topic is so bad, it's not because such a concept is too \"basic\" to even write about it, but too abstract to be completely captured in an easy way. That's also why we have so many specific geographical objects listed here, while it took several attempts to finally include \"mountain\". In fact, many articles on specific geographical objects are bot-generated on small Wikipedias anyway, and while this still leaves the task of expanding the articles to the authors, it's not quite what this list is about. To sum it up: Geographical articles are considered to be about describing, not explaining \u2013 which, however, is a convention, not a necessity or fact. Seen that way, your concerns just echo the contraints caused by the non-equal structure of Wikipedia's authorship (which, btw, not only favor \"western\" topics, but also \"male\" ones).\n::::Concerning \"forest\", I'd agree that \"rainforest\" is important enough for being listed seperately, but shouldn't all large ecozones be included in some way or another, not just \"rainforest\" and \"desert\"? This is also a main factor of the importance of islands, which often feature very distinct assemblages of species, in contrast to the political and geological concept of a \"continent\". \"Lake\" is similar in that aspect, being some kind of a counterpart to \"island\". Concerning \"city\", however, you're definitely right. I shouldn't have brought that one up in the first place. --[[User:Axolotl|Axolotl]] 09:51, 10 July 2011 (UTC)\n\n== [[:en:Franz Liszt|Franz Liszt]] ==\n\nMaybe Dvo\u0159\u00e1k should be replaced with Liszt. Although [[:en:Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] was an amazing composer, I feel that Liszt was more influential to music in general- after all, he more or less invented the [[w:recital|piano recital]] and the [[w:masterclass|masterclass]]. Perhaps, although [[:en:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] is an incredible composer, Liszt could replace him becuase they both wrote in similar styles.

If I'm right the aim of this list was to contain basic and important concepts in every knolwedge area (wasn't?). I know how difficult is to arrive to an agreement about the relative importance between different concepts (circle vs square for instance) but I think the criteria to decide can not be based on the number of wikipedias pointing to enwiki nor on the length of the English article (to cite two arguments used here in the past to promote a change). In the present case I want to remember that \"state\" was replaced by \"Sovereign state\" (a little artifical since in many languages \"state\" -without adjectives- have implicit the idea of \"sovereignty\") and a lot of wikis, in a mimetic reaction, have recently created the equivalent term without needing it since it was still covered by \"state\". In my opinion the important concept is the state as a sovereign entity independetly of the term used in any particular language, this concept of state is today a main element, the keystone of the international relations. --[[User:Loupeter|Loupeter]] 15:03, 1 July 2011 (UTC)\n:::Yes, but there are languages where there is no need for separate entries \"sovereignty\" and \"Sovereign state\" as sovereignty is used only in this meaning (for example in my language).

Populated by Arab and Berber tribes, later colonialized, then gained independence, and there it is. There is no point that says \"hey, this makes the country very significant when compared to the others\", and I'm sure if this was proposed as a new country for the list, it would fail in discussion.<br>New Zealand is especially bad, because this list already has a strong English bias, with the USA, UK, Canada and Australia all there, and a fifth English country seems way superfluous.

Bob Marley's contribution to sub-saharan African music (not just reggae) is immense, as is his influence on contemporary music world-wide. He is up there with The Beatles. The problem is that this list sounds like a fan list for a certain kind of music aficionado, rather than a world-wide overview of music.

As a side note, Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Islam are just other families in the greater christian family, not really distinct religions, so of those ten, nine have something to do with Christianity.  Also, I would not take out Paul because there are religions that worship him, not Jesus, as the son of Jehovah.  Nor would I take out Augustine of Hippo if I could avoid it, as he is important to philosophy as well as religion - his works, stripped of religious context, set out such important ideas as free will and just war, and wrote important early thought on the nature of time, thought, language, and memory.  He ''could'' be taken out, though - it seems a bit odd to me that we have Augustine of Hippo, but not the Bible.  As to Hinduism, there are few central religious figures as there are on the judeochristian tradition, and far too many gods - it's old like Shinto, as polysyncretic, dates back before modern written record, and does not have a set \"canon\" to refer to; hinduism is not a \"given\" religion as in the Abrahamic or Buddhist traditions, but a \"grown\" religion.  If any more articles need to be added for Hinduism, I think we could start with [[:en:Trimurti]] (replacing the specific Shiva) and then add [[:en:Varna]] (their infamous caste system which has influenced culture, government, and society in the region for millenia and to this day).\n:Also, I do not support adding Confucius, because anything he did for the purposes of the top 1,000 is sufficiently covered by Confucianism.

Unlike New York or LA, or even a number of smaller cities, such as Boston, DC is ''only'' internationally notable by being the capital of a powerful country, and not as a city in its own right.  And while Singapore isn't especially notable as a ''country'', as a ''city'' it's [[en:World city|one of the most important in the world]]. --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] 15:27, 21 December 2011 (UTC)\n\n:Question: why 40 countries?

As for the others, Australia, Spain, Saudi Arabia and probably Switzerland seem like good additional choices to me.<br>As for Singapore, be wary: the city of Singapore was officially dissolved in 1965, so including it as a city makes little sense. -- [[User:Liliana-60|Liliana]] [[User talk:Liliana-60|\u2022]] 16:28, 21 December 2011 (UTC)\n\n::40 countries is the number we already have.  I don't think that 40 out of 1000 is overmuch.  There's more than that in the top 1000 most visited.[http://stats.grok.se/en/] (I stopped counting when I got to 41.)  Obviously the English Wikipedia article isn't a great example, but you can try other languages, and skimming quickly see that the numbers of countries appear to be similar, though many of the particular countries vary. (Brits and Americans care about Afghanistan. Spanish speakers don't.)\n\n::I agree that we should add Kenya (see above), but I think we should include Ethiopia.  It's one of the most important countries in the history of human civilization, the only African country that remained independent, second most populous African country (and 18th most populous in the world today; it would be the only country in the top twenty we excluded), and center of pan-Africanism.\n\n::Also, I notice, surprisingly that Nepal seems to be quite popular in a number of Wikis, in the top thousand in every one I checked except Georgian, top 500 for most (and as high as 8 on the Arabic WP).   Same for most European countries, which suggests we might want to increase their representation.  Europe makes sense, since most people everywhere know multiple people who live there or have lived there, but the enduring popularity of Nepal (it seems to be consistent, I tried multiple months and years on several Wikis) baffles me.  And why is Georgian the one exception? (I tried Spanish, Turkish, Uzbek, Arabic, Indonesian, Javanese, Komi, Nahuatl, Greenlandic, Swahili, Yoruba, and Korean.)\n\n::And you're absolutely right that we can't expect people to start with 40 articles; we will have to choose a new set of vital articles.

That's probably too little for our purposes, though, so a middle ground (30? 35?) should be appropriate.<br>As for European countries, you need to watch out: from your European standpoint, it makes sense to include many European countries. However, for a user from Africa or Asia who is trying to improve his or her Wikipedia, he or she might find it appropriate that the list is so centered on a region considered \"foreign\" to them, and that doesn't have the same importance to them as it does for us. It's important that some kind of balance is maintained, even if it may be a bit difficult for us.<br>As for the cities, that would probably need to be discussed separately, although I agree that DC isn't really worth including.

Because, being smaller overall, they'd be less likely to have an article for the new topic, so their score for that line in the code would be reduced to zero, whereas the big wikis, with hundreds of thousands of articles, would be likely already to have an article in place, and their score would fall to 0.01 at worst.

And please correct me if I misunderstand or am missing something. The article seems to be telling contributors to various Wikipedias in various languages that they should prioritise articles on the listed subjects - but in many sections the subjects listed clearly reflect culture, worldviews and intellectual traditions of a specifically ''western'' tradition (for want of a more specific term). This is most obvious in the biography section, especially in the arts biographies (actors... artists... authors... composers) but is evident in many of the sections. So, for example, the simplified chinese language wiki should prioritise, within it's top 1000 articles, an article on e.g. Sarah Bernhardt?\nCan there be any conceivable justification for this stance? What is going on here? Is the wikipedia movement really to be used as yet another tool of western imperialism?

If you don't like [[en:Sarah Bernhardt]] who would be better actress for the list? --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 06:32, 9 February 2012 (UTC)\n\n::Thanks for the prompt response. I'm somewhat relieved to see that these issues have been discussed before, and find myself in broad agreement with the 'Serious Eurocentrism' concern raised by user Aghniyya, and subsequent discussion.   At this stage I will make some general suggestion on possible approaches to the list that may go some way to reducing bias, and leave specific figures/subjects out of the discussion for the time being:\n\n- The list ought to strive to reflect, in accurate proportions, the intellectual, symbolic and cultural traditions of the balance of peoples that constitute the human family today. Most importantly, there are many subjects and domains of activity and practice that simply stem from common human experience, sharing the planet, and common issues and challenges we face. These should take up the greater share of the list. The sections on the specific cultural traditions of certain societies should in fact be minimized, and to the extent that a techno-scientific worldview is also largely the product of western culture, the science subjects should not over-dominate (more on this below):\n\n- History and Geography should be most prominent. The history of nations/civilization should not focus too much on individual figures, but rather on chronologies. It should also be cautious to counter the 'history is written by the victors' syndrome, so include the perspectives of the oppressed as well as the dominant. Even where this is ugly. Think Howard Zinn. There should be much more on the history of important transitions in universal material culture such as farming and food. The establishment of these and the variety of how they are practised should be elaborated and central, as well as other material realities. But it should be balanced and not techno-progressive - for example, forager societies must be noted. The lives of the vast majority of the world's people are very much dominated and orientated towards material concerns and security, and to the extent that Wikis can contextualize such concerns, and serve as a repository for knowledge and practice in these matters, this is surely a crucially valuable role. In the same spirit, earth sciences, and information on e.g. healthy soils, biodiversity and pollution issues should play a prominent role in this list.\n\n- There is far too much material on the sciences and mathematics. This is way beyond the concerns of most people in most societies. Around half the world's population are farmers. Why do we need articles on ''Capacitor, Inductor, Transistor, Diode, Resistor, Transformer''? This is a good example of the techno-scientific bias of this list. The health and anatomy section reflects only the western medicine tradition, and it's interventionist, chemical practices, which is very different from e.g. the traditional chinese system, and indian traditions, with their whole-body, dietary practices etc. The technology section's articles on clothing / agriculture technologies and basic engineering are pitching at the right level given most people's concerns. The weapons section is just odd.\n\n- There is and should remain plenty of material on the variety worldviews, social organization and political systems, and also some reflection on the psychological and symbolic processes by which these get propagated, in order to relativize these variations somewhat, and universalize the general human experience with these things. But the analytic aspect should be not too scientific, since this may include bias. E.g. if there are to be psychology articles, they should avoid an exclusively western perspective - which is difficult given the history of the discipline. The philosophy section should be redone in much more general terms, reflecting different traditions. E.g. ''dialectic'' is not a philosophical tradition in Chinese culture nor society; all the categories here reflect purely the western tradition.\n\n- The music section is totally dominated by western traditions - I don't see anything on e.g. Chinese or Indian traditional styles or instruments in there. The article on 'opera' ''explicitly'' only treats the European tradition. That's very poor.\n\n- I could go on and on, but I won't. In summary - remove the techno-scientific progressive bias. Remove the dominance of western categories from all the general subjects (health, medicine, philosophy...etc). Remove most of the biographies, and ''minimize the cult of personality''. Go look at the most popular articles on Chinese, Indian and other wikis. Don't suggest that ''THEY SHOULD TREAT THE SUBJECTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WIKI AS THE MODEL TO BE EMULATED'' - instead, go look at their intellectual traditions, their narratives, and make the English language wiki reflect something of their worldview and culture!

This might be 10%~20%. The list can then be reconstituted with suitable fractions from e.g. Chinese (~20%), Indian ~17%, African ~17%, Middle Eastern (10~20% ?)and other societies and traditions (Japanese, Polynesian, Innuit, Native North, Central and South American. These could be at some meta-scale (e.g. 'Japan' as a whole), or preferably some specific cultural tradition within the larger nation (e.g. the Ainu culture within Japan).\n::To get ideas about what content to include from non-western cultures, either ask colleagues on other wikis to contribute suggestions, or go to the other wikis and see what e.g. which figures their popular historical biographies are on, what works of literature are considered influential, which events are focused upon in their history pages... etc.\n[[User:DMSchneider|DMSchneider]] 10:03, 13 February 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::I'm not sure that percentage of global population as the only measure is appropriate here. The fact that western culture is globally the most influential should be taken into account. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 10:23, 13 February 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::: You illustrate very succinctly precisely the problem we are attempting to address. You are justifying cultural imperialism by making reference to... cultural imperialism! Surely the essence of the whole wiki project is the converse - an attempt to get beyond such historical domination of the knowledge and world-view of the many by the few, not to replicate this domination. It is as if the liberation were intended only to democratize knowledge '''within''' the English language culture, but to maintain a non-democratic, top-down, imperialist project in the inter-cultural realm. [[User:DMSchneider|DMSchneider]] ([[User talk:DMSchneider|talk]]) 12:37, 26 February 2012 (UTC) \n\n::::: Let me ask you a similar question. For example, why should the simplified Chinese language wiki prioritise, within it's top 1000 articles, an article on e.g. [[:en:Muhammad Iqbal|Muhammad Iqbal]]? It's easy to say we should ask other language editors, but that won't solve the main problem: what criteria should we use for inclusion? The way you suggest, this list would end up as a mashup of local heroes that almost nobody could learn anything from, because their contributions were too culture-specific. You may say that this is true for the current version of the list (which you are saying), but your solution contributes nothing, except the additional problem of arguments about whose local hero is more worthy of inclusion, which would inevitably arise.\n::::: The way I see it, the only reasonable solution would be to leave out culture-specific terms as much as possible and include those that are really globally important. I agree with you that we should focus on crucial ideas and concepts rather than people or events, which would involve seriously reducing the number of biographies. In this light, focus on techno-progressivistic terms is necessary (although trimming may be needed in a couple of spots). Those are the concepts that are transforming the whole planetary society right now, and cannot be simply waved away as \"western\", as Almafeta pointed out below. They made Wikipedia possible and even a farmer will benefit from learning how. It is in my opinion not biased to exclude, say, [[:en:Hunter-gatherer]], even though it was a key period in development of modern society; this type of society, while some may still exist, is not sustainable today. However, we should look for underlying key innovations that made such transitions possible and are still relevant - concepts as [[:en:Trade]], [[:en:Division of labour]] etc.\n::::: The same idea is behind prioritizing science-based medicine over local systems of healing knowledge embedded in local mythology and tradition. What \"western\" medicine does, is to take elements of those systems that work, try to find out why they work and incorporate the findings. Sure, sometimes the way this is done can be labeled as exploitative which is deserving of all condemnation, but in general, this approach has contributed a lot to doubling the human lifespan in past 100 years. What other medicinal system can make a claim that even begins to compare? \n::::: As for your accusations of imperialistic tendencies, this part of the discussion is a dead end. I have but one quote in reply: \"Wikipedia is a mirror, not the lamp.\" \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 19:20, 25 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:A few comments.\n:#First, Wikipedia is by its nature a 'techno-scientific progressive' project; it's a project on the Internet to be read by people who are on the Internet.  The idea that technology and science are just 'tools of western imperialism' is silly.  In today's world, there is no 'eastern science' or 'western science'; there is no 'eastern technology' nor 'western technology'; and culture is eagerly following where the science and technology has led.\n:#Second, there is a ''de facto'' rule in this list mandating globalization; at least one person per continent has been included in each major area, even if there are more globally influential people.  Frida Khalo is in but Donatello is out, for example, on the sole virtue that Frida Khalo is from North America, Donatello is from Europe, and Europe has 'enough people' - even though if you ask any thousand people anywhere in the world, hundreds will have heard of Donatello while tens will have heard of Frida Khalo.  We've already gone through several cycles where all European contributions to global culture have been decimated to make room, and the entirety of American contributions to global culture is usually reserved for the North American or South American slot in the list; if you were to go any farther, you might as well ban any European or American from appearing in the list.\n:#Third, the idea that folk medicine should be treated with the same respect as actual medicine is ridiculous; [[:en:Folk medicine]] as an entire field might merit one article in the expanded list of vital articles, but it has no place in the core 1000.  The top 1000 has no room for antiscientific topics - whether eastern or western; no eastern [[:en:Accupuncture|accupuncture]] and no western [[:en:Homeopathy|homeopathy]], no eastern [[:en:Reiki|Reiki]] and no western [[:en:Humorism|humors]].\n:#Finally, the English wiki is not the model to be emulated because it's western.  It's the model to emulate because it has the most active community, the most rigorous standards for content and citation, and the highest standards for quality.  Languages don't care about borders - all language wikis can be read and edited from anywhere in the world, and nowhere is this more true than in the global community for our oldest wiki, English.\n:Sorry to come down so hard on you.  [[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 11:51, 13 February 2012 (UTC)\n\n\n\n:A response.\n:#First, Don't confuse the medium with the message. Also note the connection of this list with related projects whose goal is to create an offline/stand alone version of wikipedia, and printed versions (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Core_topics); wikipedia is not simply 'a project on the internet to be read by people on the internet'. Even if it were, this would not justify the pushing of a techno-scientific cultural perspective. Your claim that there is no distinction between western and eastern science is historically inaccurate. There are distinctions between the traditions, most clearly in medicine. I agree there is convergence, and that western science is replacing eastern science in many areas. An important question is how and why this is happening. There is a significant co-option of e.g. tradition Indian medicine practices by western pharmaceutical firms, ''very often in a manner which exploits and seeks to dominate'' those Indian traditions (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization_of_indigenous_knowledge), and is being pushed by western institutions like the WTO. Are you aware of any of this?\n:#Second, The problem is that we are claiming that other wikis should prioritize the content of this list. In other words '''''we are telling people in other cultures what and how to think'''''. This is dangerous ground, and I would argue potentially goes against the whole idea of the wiki project. If it is to be done at all, it must reflect a balanced perspective that respects the diversity of cultures around the world, not just another form of imperialism. The 'at least one person from each continent': nice idea, but many of the lists do not follow it. And even if they were to, it would still allow 80-90% of the content to reflect western influences/traditions.\n:#Third, see point one\n:#Finally, You are confusing the medium with the message again. It's great that the English language wiki is so well maintained and structured, with citation/quality standards etc. Here we are talking about the ''content'' of wikipedias. This ''List of articles every Wikipedia should have'' is essentially saying that the wikis of other cultures (languages) '''''ought to''''' prioritize a set of knowledge content and a world-view that we set out here. It is thus asserting the imposition of a set of perspectives - and is thus a form of cultural imperialism, and is dangerous. If it were the imposition of some kind of balanced multi-cultural perspectives (that I have been arguing it must strive for if it is to exists at all), there might conceivably be arguments that the positives could outweigh the negatives. But in terms of its current content, it is multicultural only to a negligible extent. In calling for the imposition of a specific cultural perspective on other cultures, it joins other historical forms of cultural imperialism. Is this really what the wikipedia movement is all about? I'd like to know whether Jimmy and other key contributors to the wiki project agree with the goals of this list.\n\n: Don't apologise. These debates are important. Sorry for the delay in responding. [[User:DMSchneider|DMSchneider]] ([[User talk:DMSchneider|talk]]) 12:37, 26 February 2012 (UTC)\n\n::I fully agree with DMSchneider. This is the most ridiculous list I habe ever seen in Wikipedia.

And becaus nobody seems to answer the questions raised bei Schneider, I repeat the most important one: \"I'd like to know whether Jimmy and other key contributors to the wiki project agree with the goals of this list.\" It would fit perfectly in the paternalism shown by Wikimedia to \"the global south\". --[[User:13Peewit|13Peewit]] ([[User talk:13Peewit|talk]]) 01:08, 24 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::You clearly have no idea about how Wikipedia works if you're asking for opinion of \"key contributors\"... \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 19:20, 25 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::Some small wikis are incredible lopsided with their article topics.

Schoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, is among the major landmarks of 20th-century musical thought; at least three generations of composers in the European and American traditions have consciously extended his thinking or, in some cases, passionately reacted against it.... Schoenberg was widely known early in his career for his success in simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify pioneering innovations in atonality that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, a widely influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation, and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.... Schoenberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential teacher of composition; his students included Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Hanns Eisler, Egon Wellesz, and later John Cage, Lou Harrison, Earl Kim, Leon Kirchner, and many other prominent musicians. Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method, and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in avant-garde musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many of the 20th century's significant musicologists and critics, including Theodor Adorno, Charles Rosen, and Carl Dahlhaus.

I would also like to see the page Liliana proposes, about \"writing\" in the sense of \"things people write,\" but that's not what [[en:Writing]] contains right now, and that would also overlap with pages called \"literature\" or the like.  We may need to look at this more globally:  what are the important things about:\n# language\n# texts (form, genre)\n# preservation of texts (writing, memorization, oral composition)\nand how many articles out of 1000 should be allocated to this area? [[User:Amahoney|A. Mahoney]] ([[User talk:Amahoney|talk]]) 13:56, 2 March 2012 (UTC)\n\nFirst, I must apologize my hasty edit and late response, sorry. Then I'll describe my thoughts. This list currently has \"alphabet\", which, strictly speaking, excludes Chinese and Japanese characters, for instance. As a Japanese, I feel the current state of the list is imcomplete or biased. However cunsuming other 2 slots by adding \"logography\" and \"syllabary\" is probably not acceptable since many people are trying hard to add articles about other topics. \"[[:en:Writing system|Writing system]]\" is a generic concept that covers segmental, logographic and syllabic systems. So replacing \"alphabet\" with \"writing system\" is my first priority. \"[[en:Writing|Writing]]\" covers similar topics but I think \"writing\" is too vague, overlaps both \"writing system\", \"literacy\" and \"literarure\", and difficult to give a clear direction so not appropriate as target to develop into big article. Besides, [[en:writing system]] has 92 interlanguage links while [[en:writing]] has 84, so I guess the former is more popular article. Adding \"writing system\" makes \"writing\" somewhat redundant and therefore remove it. This is my second priority. Those series of changes give us one extra slot. I proposed adding \"[[en:translation]]\" since I, as Japanese Wikipedian, think it very important topic. This is my third priority.

The ''first'' order of exemplification would be, not the systems of specific languages, but general topics: [[:en:Abjad|Abjad]], [[:en:Abugida|Abugida]], [[:en:Alphabet|Alphabet]], [[:en:Logogram|Logogram]], and [[:en:Syllabary|Syllabary]]. Hey, that's five right there! But we already have [[:en:Alphabet|Alphabet]], so the fifth linguistics-related topic could be [[:en:Morpheme|Morpheme]]. (Other pertinent possibilities might be [[:en:Undeciphered writing systems|Undeciphered writing systems]] and [[:en:Calligraphy|Calligraphy]].) [[Special:Contributions/71.163.201.254|71.163.201.254]] 20:59, 7 March 2012 (UTC)\n:::I support including [[:en:Writing system|Writing system]] and [[:en:Translation|Translation]], and removing the six specific writing systems.  To fill the five slots, Abjad, Abugida, Logogram and Syllabary sound too much technical, while they are (supposedly) covered by the general article for writing systems.  I like [[:en:Morpheme|Morpheme]] better. [[:en:Calligraphy|Calligraphy]] is already covered in this list. I wouldn't add [[:en:Undeciphered writing systems|Undeciphered writing systems]] because it could be a subtopic of writing system (although it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the English article). Other worthwhile candidates might be some linguists such as [[:en:P\u0101\u1e47ini|P\u0101\u1e47ini]] and [[:en:Ferdinand de Saussure|Ferdinand de Saussure]]. I would also add [[:en:International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet]] and [[:en:Dictionary|Dictionary]] (or [[:en:Lexicography|Lexicography]]) as another linguistic-related topic, which has a wide coverage in a number of languages already. --[[User:Whym|whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|talk]]) 21:37, 12 August 2012 (UTC)\nWell, looking into this again, I've changed my mind. Instead of continuing proposing a chain of changes endlessly, perhaps we should concentrate on the things we can agree relatively easily.  I can see there is substantial support for replacing [[:en:Writing|Writing]] and [[:en:Alphabet|Alphabet]] with [[:en:Writing system|Writing system]] and [[:en:Translation|Translation]], while no opposition to that has been made in the recent months.  Can we apply the change?  I think in a separate venue we can continue discussing the other points raised (including a more general article for \"things people write\", and other replacements of writing system articles with some linguistic topics). --[[User:Whym|whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|talk]]) 23:42, 18 August 2012 (UTC)\n:Proposal 1:  [[:en:Writing system|Writing system]] instead of [[:en:Writing|Writing]]:  I'm still not sure what the difference is supposed to be, but if \"writing system\" means the characters, symbols, and so on, in the sense of the book ''The World's Writing Systems'' (Daniels and Bright, Oxford UP), then I agree.

If we look at it as a plant than i could think of much more interesting plants, say for example an oak which is (mainly was) used to create lots of stuff (boats, houses, furniture). If we look at it more as a product being used then I think more interesting things could be named. I don't understand why there should be 6 fruits for two reasons: normally I believe the plant which grow the fruits would be considered what you write about, the fruit being a section of that description. If you look at is as plants (there are no specific plants in the list) more interesting plants could be thought of. On the other hand there is the factor it plays in live. I wouldn't consider specific fruits to be that huge of an impact (also when not looking to the western or current cultures).

Notice the introduction of the former \"The word 'sea' is often used interchangeably with 'ocean'...\" and of the latter: \"Sometimes the terms sea and ocean are used synonymously.\" In some languages there is not a very clear distinction (like with the concepts ''city'' \u2013 ''town''). I think it could be removed to give place to something else. I will not suggest a replacement, since I'm sure there are already several good suggestions just waiting for a place on the list.\n\nMoreover I think we should be careful with concepts that are not very clearly defined or where the words are ambiguous in English. Because this list is the basis of a ranking, many people want to add their language as an iw-link resulting in big iw-complications. Some problematic entries are [[:en:Sex]] and [[:en:Law]] (quite different concepts are connected to these articles, if you look at the iw-links). --[[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] ([[User talk:Wikijens|talk]]) 21:58, 10 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n:Perhaps we should replace [[:en:Sea|Sea]] with [[:en:Cartography|Cartography]], which is also a basic geographic concept.  I agree that \"sea\" and \"ocean\" are not really different, and it's only a matter of convention that we refer to the \"Mediterranean Sea\" but the \"Atlantic Ocean\" and so on. [[User:Amahoney|A. Mahoney]] ([[User talk:Amahoney|talk]]) 21:02, 11 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n\n::Yes, [[:en:Cartography|Cartography]] is a good suggestion, but i think it is better to keep [[:en:Sea|Sea]] and replace [[:en:Ocean|Ocean]]. --[[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] ([[User talk:Wikijens|talk]]) 19:28, 12 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::Agree, except why keep \"Sea\" instead of \"Ocean\"? Ocean would logically link the all the major Oceans of the world; would talk about ocean currents, hurricanes, global exploration and other important topics. Sea on the other hand would be basically a list various unrelated bodies of water that tend to be salty. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 05:23, 13 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::I think that in many languages Sea ([[:de:Meer]], [[:el:\u0398\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1]], [[:fr:Mer]], [[:sv:Hav]]) is the general term and the term Ocean just marks a technical distinction. I believe that in all these languages and several others people would talk about the sea when looking from land for example at the Atlantic even if it is technically an ocean. Introduction to many articles about the sea (I checked also Italian and Spanish) includes two definitions of the term sea, either as distinct from ocean, or as including the total body if saline waters of the earth. Notice also iw-links from the article [[:en:Seawater|Seawater]], which almost all have as an element the equivalent of the word sea, even if it obviously includes the water of the oceans. Finally the fact that almost all languages have a word for ocean directly derived from the greek word, while words for sea seem to be local, shows that the latter is a notion which is important in many different cultures, while the former is rather som technical distinction. --[[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] ([[User talk:Wikijens|talk]]) 14:03, 14 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n: If we want to remove one of these (not sure about it, a lot of languages have the difference between them), why adding Cartography?

And geography has already plenty of articles--[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] ([[User talk:Barcelona|talk]]) 18:39, 13 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n== Family and relationships ==\nI think almost the whole category could be removed to give place to other subjects. At least [[:en:Child]] seems unnecessary to me. [[:en:Man]] and [[:en:Woman]] I also find unnecessary as we have [[:en:Human]]. If [[:en:Sex]] is removed and replaced by both [[:en:Sexual intercourse]] and [[:en:Gender]], we have covered most of the wanted ideas. To add up my suggestion:\n*add [[:en:Sexual intercourse]] and [[:en:Gender]]\n*remove [[:en:Child]], [[:en:Man]], [[:en:Woman]], [[:en:Sex]]\nThis leaves two free spaces for other articles. --[[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] ([[User talk:Wikijens|talk]]) 22:39, 10 July 2012 (UTC)\n:Maybe [[:en:Sexual reproduction]] instead of [[:en:Sexual intercourse]], I'm not sure about that. The reason I want to remove Sex is shown more clearly in [[:fr:Sexe|the french article]]: \"Le mot '''sexe''' d\u00e9signe souvent ''l'appareil reproducteur'', ou ''l\u2019acte sexuel'' et ''la sexualit\u00e9'' dans un sens plus global, mais se r\u00e9f\u00e8re aussi aux ''diff\u00e9rences physiques distinguant les hommes et les femmes''.\" So for all languages not deriving from latin, there might be three or four words covering these concept. We should choose one ore or two of them. --[[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] ([[User talk:Wikijens|talk]]) 22:54, 10 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n:My two cents: \"Child\", \"Man\" and \"Woman\" on the surface seems like little more than definitions. But since we are missing various topics associated with raising children, parenting, topics specific to men, topics that only affect women, I think these are core topics that would connect to a lot of topics we wouldn't necessarily want in this list. Removing \"Sex\" I think is an improvement since the topic is a bit to broad but your two replacements don't seem necessary. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 05:40, 13 July 2012 (UTC)\n:: I'd strongly keep man, woman and child, if they are just definitions, improve them, but all them refer to basic topics. If we have reproduction (in general) we shouldn't have sexual reproduction, or we should add the other types of reproduction systems. That makes sense to me. I disagree with sexual intercourse, too specific--[[User:Barcelona|Barcelona]] ([[User talk:Barcelona|talk]]) 18:45, 13 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::Good point about reproduction, so I agree that sexual reproduction is not necessary. I find the article [[:en:Sex]] problematic because it seems to be mainly about sexual reproduction even if there is a seperate article about this. Maybe this part could be made less dominant in the article, and iw's such as [[:de:Sex]] could be removed/changed? I disagree about man, woman, child. I doubt you would find single entries about these terms even in a quite big conventional encyclopedia, rather there would be a short definition in a dictionary. In my opinion an article about [[:en:Family]] is enough or there could be introduced in the list something like [[:en:Ageing]] or perhaps [[:en:Gender]] if the biological aspects are not enough. I hope I haven't made too many suggestions at the same time :-) --[[User:Wikijens|Wikijens]] ([[User talk:Wikijens|talk]]) 15:06, 14 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n::: I believe that [[:en:Gender]] is a better replacement of Man/Woman - it could cover rather well the subject of the 2 articles. --[[User:Nk|Nk]] ([[User talk:Nk|talk]]) 13:07, 2 August 2012 (UTC)\n\n: Bad idea. As a representative of the language in which different words are uses for different notions, I see that you propose to replace the entry from the biological section (sex) with an entry from the societal section (gender). The biological sex should stay. And the entry feminism partly covers gender. More in a separate article but I don't see the ''should be in every wikipedia'' importance to it. As for man, woman and child, IMHO, they should be in every wikipedia. Certainly, they are in every wikipedia, aren't they? If they are not, that's too bad. If you were writing a wikipedia in a new language, what does comes first, woman or gender? It is woman. --[[Special:Contributions/93.73.19.163|93.73.19.163]] 17:03, 14 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n== Track and field vs. Athletics ==\n\nIn English WP there are two separate articles, [[:en:Track and field]] and [[:en:Athletics]], and a debate going on on the talk page of the latter about whether these actually are two different topics or not.

They seem very obviously equally important. But, that said, Thucydides did more than Herodotus to shape historiography, which, under his influence, has become primarily the study of political history (including the history of war). Perhaps every Wikipedia should have an article on Ancient Greek historiography, thus including both Herodotus and Thucydides as well as other very important figures (e.g. [[en:Xenophon|Xenophon]] and [[en:Polybius|Polybius]]). After all, one can argue that the Ancient Greek historians collectively created the tradition of (at least) Western historiography. --[[User:Cessator|Cessator]] ([[User talk:Cessator|talk]]) 22:17, 2 December 2012 (UTC)\n\n=== Srivijaya ===\n[[:en:Srivijaya]] could replace one of cities.

A comment was also made on the discussion page here. The problem has not been addressed. This bias is particularly egregious if you consider that this document is intended for Wikipedias in mostly non-European languages. Perhaps the most egregious example is the inclusion of [[w:Paul the Apostle]] instead of adding someone from a non-Christian religion (e.g. [[w:Zoroaster]]. If celebrities from other continents are not to be found, then the list should reduce its reliance on biographies and focus on more universal concepts. Thanks, [[User:Groupuscule|Groupuscule]] ([[User talk:Groupuscule|talk]]) 09:13, 22 October 2012 (UTC)\n: Initial list was far more eurocentric. Now it is more balanced. As for Zoroaster, there is Zoroastrism, which is enough. Meso-american religions are not represented. The pressure of English is subtler thing.

Then I would think American football, Basketball, Figureskating and Tennis each could be reduced by 30%. I think Soccer is the sport that would need the biggest increase, being the #1 or #2 sport in basically all countries around the world except the US and Canada. I also would add some to Motorsports.

But the equivalence between symmetries and conservation laws is very deep and essential to 20th c. physics.  Also, Avicenna does not really belong as a scientist -- he's much more of a philosopher.  A better choice for a scientist would be Alhacen, who really was responsible in a certain decisive way for \"reasoning from experiment.\"\n:: Huh? Noether should be higher in priority than ''David Hilbert''? David Hilbert was certainly much more influential. Hilbert developed fundamental aspects of the theory of ideals (later Noether worked in this area, too). He was probably the most influential formalist, and formalism significantly influenced ''all'' areas of mathematics and even the conception of what mathematics are. He developed an axiomatisation of euclidean geometry and a calculus for first-order logic. In 1915 he formulated General Relativity using variational calculus (Noether also worked on variational calculus). Numerous of his 23 problems had significant impact on the roads of research in the next decades. --[[User:Chricho|Chricho]] ([[User talk:Chricho|talk]]) 01:34, 16 June 2013 (UTC)\n:: Regarding \u201cjust a third big master of mathematics of his time and the three of them are close in time and space\u201d: A replacement of Fourier by Hilbert would even broaden the temporal range. --[[User:Chricho|Chricho]] ([[User talk:Chricho|talk]]) 01:52, 16 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Concrete suggestion:\n:* Brahmagupta should replace Fibonacci.

Merely being a recipient of that prize doesn't establish notability on par with Shakespeare. The prize to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was also poorly received by critics, because he is not considered a that great author, and the Mahfouz guy seems just obscure. Thousands of people have received Nobel Prizes.

Moreover, why remove Mahfouz simply because you've never heard of him?  Perhaps Mark Twain should be removed instead, or some other author?  Finally, some of us strongly prefer that changes happen ''earlier'' in the month, since this list drives the [[List of Wikipedias by sample of articles]] scoring.  I'm going to revert the change for now.  When there's general agreement about whether to add Ibsen, and which author should go out to make space for him, ''then'' the change can happen.

I don't consider him relatively obscure just because I've never heard of him, but primarily because his (rather short) English Wikipedia biography doesn't establish or indicate any notability beyond that of other less well-known Nobel Prize in Literature laureates. Various database searches seem to support this, for example Henrik Ibsen gives 1 480 000 results in Google Books compared to 72 000 for Mahfouz.

Most of its entries are, and invariably have to be, very arbitrary; different persons want to know different things, and the realm of knowledge is infinite.\n\nWe might argue about what topics are universally important and what are not, and seek to fit the list into the number of exactly a ''thousand'' articles (although even the distribution of material among articles depends on the language to use, and some words, especially very common ones, like \"mind\" or \"man\", have no direct translation to some languages that use other words to break down and present the concept, which words, in their turn, have no translation to English), and speak, and try to persuade, but the arguments to make always depend on the culture and language, and so, argumentation lacks its point unless the language and the culture are known; argumentation in favor of one topic to exclude another usually has to be vague.\n\nI think that a group of Wikipedians who create a new Wikipedia know a lot better what their Wikipedia should have at its beginnings than we do here; and then expansion goes in a natural process as the new Wikipedia evolves: people who speak the language of the new Wikipedia demand knowledge and write articles on topics that interest them. So, I guess it's very amusing to discuss what titles should be included in the list and what titles they should replace, but such discussion has no use. Except, well, the result has interesting informations on its own; but better still, these informations could be presented in other places, like \"''List of the most influental Chinese people throughout the history of China''\" or \"''List of influental mathematicians''\". ;-) \u2013 [[Special:Contributions/89.110.10.193|89.110.10.193]] 01:12, 12 February 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Your doubt is noted, although I'm not sure what did you want to achieve by expressing it. As explained in the introduction, some language projects are quite stagnant, so obviously their communities aren't so sure on how to commence this \"natural growth\". This list is therefore intended as a suggestion (although its title may be worded a bit too harsh) which, according to statistics, many people across the world do use. Its entries, in general, are universally important, or nearly so (at least in classing encyclopedic sense), being of course also subject to compromise and tweaking - as every other Wikimedia page. They are also the subjects on which many sources exist, so it's generally easier to write about them, therefore stimulating growth by the virtue of red links to non-existing related articles. Everybody is of course free to write about anything they want, and local Wikipedias also have their local lists. Again, I'm not sure what you wanted to achieve by the above message, except maybe implying own superiority with snarky comments about you being amused by our activity (which is not exactly relevant). If you don't consider this list useful, you're free to ignore it, you know? \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 09:49, 12 February 2013 (UTC)\n\n:: \"''Its entries, in general, are universally important''\": Well, the list is only as good as it is structured. In sections where it is structured, it is indeed a guideline: it is easy to use only the structure, and revise the details to achieve a good \"classically encyclopaedic\" result. The list is a continuous problem in the sections that are not structured and constitute nothing more than a sublist: one country, city, person, language, or river is just as good as every other one to make up an article, and it's useless to discuss candidatures. So, the basic structure had been laid out early (it is not as hard, but does indeed require a work), and since then, the discussions proceed mostly on: 1] candidatures, 2] some \"basic concepts\" (I'm having difficulties imagining a person who would look up in a newly created Wikipedia who is a man or a woman). Such discussions are interesting for themselves when they concern candidatures (especially people, and especially if the discutant makes real arguments about the person's life and achievements), and not quite so when they concern \"basic concepts\" (because the arguments for their importance are usually self-evident and directly follow from the structure of coverage), but they do not achieve any goal. Informations are interesting, their exchange is nice, but they get lost here.\n\n:: So, to reiterate the conclusion: in fact the compromise is not needed, because real Wikipediae do not contain compromises, but real articles; all is needed is structure; it is the structure that may be \"universally important\", not the entries. An alternative is a list of articles that are, true, important, with the exception that they are not ''generically'' important in the academical sense, but \"very likely\" important if premised that a newly created Wikipedia follows a specific goal to be guessed... In 2007 someone posted a good example of such a list (very nice job, the niciest of all, I'd say). If these things are not of help, then nothing else is.

For example, the list says \"Homer\" and the name is a link to [[:en:Homer]].  It might be useful instead to link to the relevant Wikidata entity, [[:d:Q6691]] in this example, because that's now our definition of the concept, person, place, or whatever.  \n\nIt's perhaps ''also'' useful to provide a link to an article, whether in English or in Simple or wherever else, or maybe even to a couple of articles, in case a reader of this list wants more detail.

And then either having an article about the main pyramids or an article about each pyramid. But if a wiki has the necropolis article and the individual pyramids (ie. english wp) then selecting that 'Giza Pyramids' for this list is forcing them to create article just to fulfill this list.

Number theory has a long history and is obviously more important than for example the Pythagorean theorem. I am unsure about the Pythagorean theorem, it is not particularly important, there are many theorems in elementary geometry, but it is especially popular among laymen. Let me describe the geometry articles in the list (I think there are too many geometry-related entries): \u201cArea\u201d and \u201csymmetry\u201d are quite general concepts in geometry with generalisations which are essential even in modern mathematics. Pi and the Pythagorean theorem are particularly popular (my subjective view, maybe it is not a universal phenomenon but biased: laymen regard \u03c0 as \u201cthe\u201d (interesting) number and the Pythagorean theorem as \u201cthe\u201d theorem). There are also \u201cangle\u201d and \u201ctrigonometry\u201d. I think at least one of them should leave the list. Both are closely related (\u201cangle\u201d: a fundamental geometric figure; \u201ctrigonometry\u201d: study of another fundamental geometric figure, namely triangles, angles are particularly important here). Since trigonometry needs angles I suggest to replace trigonometry by G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems.\n::Another objection: Why is there \u201carea\u201d \u2013 why do we emphasize the two-dimensional case? \u201cLength\u201d or \u201cvolume\u201d would work as-well. I favour to have such a link, since such notions of \u201csize\u201d are essential in mathematics, even historically. But it is bad to choose arbitrarily the two-dimensional case. Is there any idea how to choose an article? (and I do not think that \u201cmeasure theory\u201d would be a good idea, that is a modern, abstract subject, the general idea of \u201csize\u201d does not depend on it) --[[User:Chricho|Chricho]] ([[User talk:Chricho|talk]]) 00:12, 18 June 2013 (UTC)\n:::I agree that \"area\" is pretty marginal.  Symmetry is important beyond mathematics (e.g. in visual arts) so I'd keep that.  For me, what matters about the Pythagorean theorem is Fermat/Wiles;  neither the Pythagorean theorem nor \"Fermat's Last Theorem\" is all ''that'' important on its own, but the idea of trying to generalize this simple, ancient fact about triangles, and the fact that it took ''400 years'' to prove that the obvious conjecture is in fact true, is a nice story about how mathematics really works.  Although the Wiles proof is not at all accessible to non-specialists, the theorems and the history are -- so I'd keep this.

Molluscs are important as food source (e.g. clams), luxury materials source (e.g. pearles), pathogens (e.g. shistosoma) and popular as spectacular animals (octopuses, calmars, tridacnas). Separately arthropods and insects are very important, but does their mutual presence on the list outweights the importance of molluscs?

Bluntly put, Bivalves are semi-important as food and Cephalopods are popular, but not nearly as important (or popular) as Insects by themselves, nor are they together as important as Arthropods or Insects.

However Merriam Webster lists it as a synonym for Apoidea. \n\n::My suggestion is to only rely on well known scientific names when including forms of life on this list and not the common English term for a kind of group of living things. Since we have to rely on a term easily translated to other languages if it is supposed to be on this list we should use something with a clear definition. Then it is either the scientific name or some other well defined feature commonly used in many languages. The same problem applies to Elephant where enwiki have different articles for the term Elephant (Elephantidae excluding mammoths) and Elephantidae (including mammoths). Other wikis might have just one of them and might consider it weird not to consider mammoths a kind of elephant since they are in the same family. - [[User:Averater|Averater]] ([[User talk:Averater|talk]]) 18:46, 8 October 2013 (UTC)\n\n== For my previous edit ==\n\nMy edit of\nremoving Q8222 Hangul Q8209 Cryllic Q8216 Greek Q8229 Latin Q8196 Arabic\nand adding Q182133 Syllabary Q38592 Devanagari Q9779 alphabet Q179461 religious text Q693 fable\nare all mentioned above and no one oppose so I made those changes...anyway, let me raise the discussion again, anyone have a better idea over it or think that above changes should not be made or disagree with reasons that I given in previous discussions?[[User:C933103|C933103]] ([[User talk:C933103|talk]]) 12:50, 10 October 2013 (UTC)\n\n:In my opinion, these changes are precipitate and not enough reasoned in the entry '''Suggestion about item changes''' dated on 22 July 2013 in this discussion page.

Since Wikipedia (in all its versions) is an on-line encyclopedia, topics related to computers and the internet are prominent in the minds of some editors, to an extent probably greater than their real importance in the broad sweep of history.  I'm not sure we can say now that video games are more important than, say, chess or soccer -- but let's revisit the topic in 100 years! :-)   I wouldn't say categorically that video games ''shouldn't'' be on this list, but I don't see what this article would displace.

We have many Wikipedia projects for languages spoken by a small population in third world developing countries in Africa and Asia. I'm pretty sure it would be quite unnecessary for the Xhosa Wikipedia or the Zulu Wikipedia to have an article on ''Call of Duty 4''. --<span style=\"border:1px solid yellow;padding:1px;\">[[User:benlisquare|<font style=\"color:#FFFF00;background:red;\">'''&nbsp;\u674e\u535a\u6770&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span> | <small>\u2014[[User talk:benlisquare|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|contribs]] </small> 13:20, 9 November 2013 (UTC)\n\n\n== Just a suggestion == \nIt seems to me that this list is being compiled as a list of what topics wikipedia editors think are the most important topics for an encyclopedia, but if the intention is to provide a list of articles that will help a wikipedia to get started and become an active useful project then it seems to me that a better approach might be to list articles that wikipedia READERS want to see. If the readers of a particular wiki project can find articles on what they want to know about when they search for them it seems likely that they will spend more time using the wiki and hence being more inclined to help contribute to it. \nA basic suggestion for how the wants of readers could be ascertained is either to use google analytics/trends to find out what people in a particular language are searching for  when they include the terms wiki, wikipedia etc. Obviously using any data that is available about the actual search function within each wikipedia would be useful to. \nAnyway, it just seemed a little redundant to me to try and improve a wiki project by first improving articles that editors think are important if readers don't care about them. [[User:Loganrah|Loganrah]] ([[User talk:Loganrah|talk]]) 06:10, 10 November 2013 (UTC)\n\n:I recall seeing the list of most searched topic for a Wikipedia somewhere, but I forgot where. However, the basic assumption is that the number of editors improving this page is large enough to give a meaningful approximation of what the readers might need, too. Additionally, the \"currently the most popular topics\" are something quite different than \"most important topics\". Do you really believe all Wikipedias should have an article about Kim Kardashian whom nobody will even remember in two years? I'm sure that she's being far more searched for right now than William Shakespeare (for example), but replacing him would make us laughing stock of pretty much everybody.\n:What you're suggesting would make sense for every Wikipedia separately - to help editors respond to trends, but not in a centralized way like this. So every local editor community would do this in their own project space. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 08:01, 10 November 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Ah, found it: http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikipedia/en/searchTerms.htm - the latest list is for the month 08/2009, but you can get the picture.

Right now there are two articles on Hinduism, which is an important religion for sure, but Trimurti as a concept is still relatively peripheral and not so known (more useful/popular topics would in fact be Shiva or Vishnu, I think). Shinto is usually considered a world religion, but now it's missing. Also, there are already actually four major religions practised in India in the list: Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism and Jainisim, and Yoga as well. Of course Japan would then in a way have Shinto, Buddhism and Zen, but I think the list would still be more balanced. --[[User:Epiq|Epiq]] ([[User talk:Epiq|talk]]) 22:27, 16 November 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Trimurti replaced Shiva as a more general concept (see the [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Archives/2011#Shiva -> Trimurti|archive section]]). I can't judge how much sense does that make, and there hasn't been much discussion about it, but I don't think that Shinto, as an almost exclusively Japanese religious practice, would be a better option. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 13:30, 18 November 2013 (UTC)\n\n::I think that reasoning is a bit strange. Jainism and Sikhism are also almost exclusively Indian practices, as is Trimurti as well. In any case Trimurti is not a good topic for this list, it's much too \"technical\" in the sense that it is rather a theological concept than something that is commonly used and easy to write about. According to one statistic (in Wikipedia) the largest religions in the world are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, various folk religions, Taoism and Confucianism, Shinto, Sikhism and Judaism. Jainism has much fewer followers and Zoroastrianism is a very small religion but they both have historical importance, so I do understand their inclusion, but Shinto is the only major singular religion currently missing from this list. It is for certain a much better choice for a topic than Trimurti. --[[User:Epiq|Epiq]] ([[User talk:Epiq|talk]]) 17:00, 19 November 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::I agree with your argument about numbers, but in my opinion, the solution would then be to replace Jainism and Sikhism with something more important.

There is not any exponent from Africa, and many sub-regions of the world were not contemplated. I will not deny that the artists selected were (and are) very important and have left a notorious legacy to humanity, but the selection criteria was made with a \"eurocentered mind\", I mean, considering and including more Europeans maybe due to not know other cultures. \n<small>Later I will continue...</small>\n\n--[[User:Zerabat|Zerabat]] ([[User talk:Zerabat|discusi\u00f3n]]) 19:11, 26 February 2014 (UTC)\n\n::Looks like you didn't understand me. Stating the obvious (numbers and ratios) doesn't help, you should propose whom to remove from the list and whom to add. Then we can discuss.

Regarding the list, I think ''Bernhardt, Sarah'' is not as vital as others. Also (this is an important issue, please do not avoid it) it is western-biased. --[[User:Zerabat|Zerabat]] ([[User talk:Zerabat|discusi\u00f3n]]) 02:10, 3 April 2014 (UTC)\n::::The list is also male-biased, and would be even more so if Sara Bernhardt was removed. One problem is that the world is pretty much western-biased. Historical people from Europe are (because of imperialism) often well known all over the world, while historical people from other parts of the world often are basically unknown outside their own countries. But if you find topics that you think should be in this list, and topics here that shouldn't be, and motivate why they should replace each other, I'm sure it would be taken under consideration. Please look in the archives for this discussion page about how replacement suggestions previously have been made. [[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 14:03, 3 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n::I think the whole concept of the page doesn't really cope with the way languages work in the world. What sense does it make for a handful of people to issue a [[w:en:Fatwa|Fatwa]] to all the people working on different languages as if they simply '''have''' to reproduce the same set of articles? This is not the wiki-way and perhaps is better suited to Larry Sanger's [http://en.citizendium.org/ Citizendium] which uses a more top down approach which would enable those of us who see themselves as having expertise in such a generalist way to work without the constraint of taking into account those of us who want a more egalitarian approach. For myself, I feel it might be more useful if different language Wikipedias set their own targets, and perhaps a reasonably simple way could be used (perhaps with Wikidata) to link the different conceptions that would then emerge.[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 10:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC)\n:::If you don't want to use this list, you don't have to. It's just a tool. By the way, the users active here are from lots of different Wikipedias. [[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 14:03, 3 April 2014 (UTC)\n:::Nobody is forcing anyone to create articles on this list. They're merely unofficial suggestions, and should be treated as such. [[User:PiRSquared17|PiRSquared17]] ([[User talk:PiRSquared17|talk]]) 15:04, 3 April 2014 (UTC)\n::The metaphor of ''Fatwa'' was used precisely because it contains within it the notion of an influential opinion, rather than implying any coercion. I certainly agree that the term ''should'' is not as strong as ''has to'' or even ''must'', but even so it is stonger than ''suggest''. However, I do not think that such fine points of English grammar should distract us from the main point, which is the bias in the list. I am not sure whether the issue can be sorted out using the one in, one out method, and certainly feel that the advent of Wikidata could help us find a way of co-ordinating between different languages wich does not involve producing Eurocentric lists like this.[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 00:59, 4 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n==Microsoft Windows under Operating System==\n63% of the world's computers run some windows OS, so it's a relatively high-demand article. Microsoft revolutionized personal computing and brought it to the masses, so I think either them or their OS deserves a spot on this list for standing out so much. [[User:NottNott|NottNott]] ([[User talk:NottNott|talk]]) 21:42, 26 March 2014 (UTC)\n\n:This kind of reasoning is problematic because arguably, Microsoft's role in the PC revolution is shared with Apple (opinions differ to what extent). That's two spots already. Then, if we include these two, other famous companies will start creeping in. So I say no, let's stick to general concepts, everything else is of secondary importance. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 10:08, 27 March 2014 (UTC)\n\n==Musicians==\nWhy is there only one Black musician in the list?[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 20:49, 2 April 2014 (UTC)\n:Do you have a specific proposal to replace one of the musicians with another?

If you know of more please make a suggestion for a change in the list. [[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 06:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)\n\nInteresting point, systemic bias might arise because of lack of research skills amongst engaged editors or from bias as regards what they think important. Actually my concern here is rather with reviewing the methodology than contributing to a method which seems flawed.[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 13:32, 4 April 2014 (UTC)\n:So, basically you're only here to complain, and you're not willing to help? Or do you have any suggestions for a different methodology? [[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 14:17, 4 April 2014 (UTC)\nI am not quite sure why you posed me these questions. Perhaps you might care to reread my posting above. One of the way Wikipedia works is that it is based on evidence rather than opinion. This is why the encyclopedia has made such leaps forward since adding references became the norm. The problem with the methodology here is that \"importance\" seems to boil down to opinion, and indeed opinions very much constructed out of various aesthetic and cultural values. I am certainly keen to explore ways of developing a different methodology, but perhaps this exploration could start with an explanation of why the current methodology has been adopted?[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 18:11, 4 April 2014 (UTC)\n:Current methodology has been you must discuss any changes beforehand and reach consensus. As for what consensus means that appears to be have a few people agree with you and no one disagree with you. Usually this entails just changing one or two entries at a time. Of course, this would all be based on opinion. This list is not about whether someone is notable but what is the relative importance. So, this will always be based on opinion. (eg. who are the 21 most important musicians?).\n:Something you point out that I think is interesting. This list seems to at times go around in this pattern (1) why is this list so biased in this way.. lets add some entries to balance (2) what are these entries doing here that are not that notable.. let add the old entries back. We should have a reference for each entry that points to the discussion in the archive where it was debated. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 19:04, 4 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n::Funny, I once started to make such an index, but gave up soon because it needs to be done manually and it was too tedious. Should I publish as it is and we'll finish it together?\n:::Sure, I will try to help. But lately my time for wikipedia work is shrinking. I was thinking that each time we have a discussion about any given entry we just add a reference to the discussion. Maybe even a bot could be able to do it. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 08:03, 7 April 2014 (UTC)\n:::: I put it at [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Archives/Topic index]]. As I said, I gave up soon. A bot may help for clear cases, but it will still have to be a largely manual task. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 17:10, 10 April 2014 (UTC)\n::To [[User:Leutha|Leutha]]: the question why the methodology is such as it is probably doesn't have a comprehensive answer. This list goes back to early days of Wikipedia itself and it probably just seemed a good idea at the time. It might help to go through the discussion archives and edit histories if you're actually interested. As to your proposal, it might help to explain what you're actually getting at instead of playing on other editors' emotions by calling us biased and incompetent. Your hints simply remind us of the idea to make quotas for each cultural area, which was proposed long ago and already decided against. In case you haven't noticed, the world is Western-biased. And Wikipedia has, by its verifiability rules, decided to \"be a mirror, not the lamp\". Example: Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra regularly plays Beethoven, Mahler and other classical European composers. How many Southeast-Asian composers are on regular program anywhere outside Southeast Asia? I dare say that with our \"flawed\" approach, we got pretty close to listing subjects which are the most sought after in all Wikipedias combined in the long run (i.e. excluding fads). So you'll have to do better than that if you want the community to take you seriously. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 08:02, 5 April 2014 (UTC)\nFirstly, I feel your suggestion that I am \"playing on other editors' emotions\" is misplaced. As other editors have pointed out, the list as it is currently constructed will always be based on opinion. In this sense we can see the work on this list as a form of [[w:en:affective labour|affective labour]] creating what [[w:en:Michael Betancourt|Michael Betancourt]] calls \"systemic unknowns\", in this case a putatively measurable notion of \"importance\" by which the individual candidates can be theoretically be ordered. So, I would suggest that any experience of emotional upset you may experience arises from the nature of this list and your personal valorisation of it through the affective labour you have already given it. As regards your view of the world being western-biased, even if this holds water, it only goes to highlight the ommission of Black musicians. I think you will find that such musicians as [[w:en:Jimi Hendrix|Jimi Hendrix]] and [[w:en:Bob Marley|Bob Marley]] are westen musicians.\nI found [[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]]'s point very interesting, and sympathise with anyone who stands back from such labour intensive work, particularly when there is some doubt about whether it will be well received. Of course we have Wikipedia article traffic statistics, and I hope no-one will get upset if I point out that for [http://stats.grok.se/en/top April 2013] Bob Marley came in at 387th (402,367 hits) whilst [[w:en:Ludwig van Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven]] was a little bit lower down the list at 810th (281,283 hits). As for [[w:en:Gustav Mahler|Gustav Mahler]] I am sorry to report I could not find him in the list no matter how hard I looked.\n[[File:V\u011btru\u0161e, zrcadlov\u00e9 bludi\u0161t\u011b nohy.jpg|right|thumb|House of Mirrors, a common feature at the funfair]]\nWhilst I take on board the comment about wikipedia being a mirror, I feel that this page is perhaps somewhat more like the \"House of Mirrors\". I don't want to be a killjoy, and I know how much fun people can get from drawing up lists of their favourites under all sorts of categories. But I feel that it would be a good idea if this was done somewhere else. If there is to be [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have]] then I feel it requires a lot more thought. I also hope that when I point out a lack of research skills amongst engaged editors, this is not a matter of calling people incompetent, but rather indicating that the questions which arise from having a page like this may involve serious reflection concerning how can enhance the collective pool of skills, ideally simplified through the development of new tools, so that we can address the shortcomings of the list.[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 20:20, 8 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:Well of course I am emotionally vested in a work that is partly my creation, at least a little bit. However, me being upset (if you insist on talking about me, although \"annoyed\" would be a better description) stems largely from the fact that you started criticizing our work, indirectly and without providing a clear alternative. Even if you didn't intend it, your hint dropping came across as smug, which continues with your last message. The present list ''was'' given a lot of thought - 10 years of it, to be precise. I'm not saying that it can't be improved, but I'd appreciate if you finally explained what you're getting at instead of poking. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 16:46, 10 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:Have to agree with Yerpo. There isn't a lot of commenters in this list so I am willing to accept any suggestions about articles or methodology.  But you haven't really offered any specific yet. Using popularity as a way to get importance will just mean this is the \"list of the most popular articles\". The original goal of this list was to promote articles that are obviously important but missing. Promoting already popular articles is a really unnecessary task. So, IMHO, if you were to tweak the methodology I would not go in that direction. I do believe it can be tweaked in other directions. Perhaps we have a rule, the topic must have had influence in more than one continent. Is Bob Marley important outside North America? Is Gustav Mahler important outside Europe?  --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 20:25, 10 April 2014 (UTC)\n\nWell, I am also not the only person to be \"annoyed\" by the bias in this list, as anyone who looks through the archives can verify. I agree that popularity has its shortcomings. However, it does have the advantage in that we can consider it in a more objective way, whereas I am not sure how we can approach \"importance\" in a clearer way. It is hard for me to come up with solutions unless you can tell me what you mean by this category. Otherwise we are dealing with what a mentioned above, a \"systemic unknown\". In fact, I would suggest that it is a sounder approach to start off with an analysis of the problem, rather than a putative solution, because otherwise we are likely to get into the sort of futile discussion, we can be worse than annoying.\n[[File:Continental models-Australia.gif|thumb|300px|Animated, color-coded map showing the various continents and regions. [[w:en:Continent#Separation of continents|Depending on the convention and model]], some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, [[w:en:Eurasia|Eurasia]] is most often subdivided into [[w:en:Europe|Europe]] and [[w:en:Asia|Europe]] (red shades), while [[w:en:North America|North]] and [[w:en:South America|South America]] are sometimes recognized as [[w:en:Americas|one American continent]] (green shades).]]\nThanks to [[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] for the suggestion of using what we might call the \"continent approach\". Assuming we set aside antarctica, when we [[w:en:Continent#Area_and_population|compare the continental populations]], it is a bit disturbing to discover that Australia, population 29,127,000, would have the same weight as Asia, population 4,164,252,000, a ratio of 1:143. Or comparing two hit scenarios, Europe and Australia add up to 767,326,000 whereas Africa and Asia add up to 5,186,486,000 a ratio of 1:6.76. However, as it is two hit measures this has to be more or less squared, giving a figure of around 1:45. Bearing in mind the demographics of the countries involved, this way would also be liable to bias, even if it gives us a clearer idea of how that bias arises. Unless we simplify things by reducing it to \"important in Asia\" (as 60% of the world's population live there), I think we need another approach. I wonder if we can agree on a shared notion that importance is related to human beings. Would that be a useful next step?[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 18:08, 11 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:I agree \"importance is related to human beings\" but not sure exactly what you mean. I wouldn't want to weight the article counts by population counts. Otherwise we'll just mainly have Chinese and Indian articles.\n:My suggestion, as a way to finally get rid of the constant complaint that the list is biased, would be that the topic must be important to more than one culture. (Instead of continents we could use a  [http://andrewclem.com/Politics/Maps/World_cultural_regions.gif world map of cultures]). The means a Western person only important in the West would not be in the list. An Asian person only important in Asia is not in the list. This could dramatically change the list of people which seems to be the articles most complained about. But beware this might mean Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix are not getting in the list. But an argument could be made for someone like [[w:Youssou N'Dour|Youssou N'Dour]] if he is important enough in Europe. Also, in thinking this though it might caused Shakespeare and George Washington to be removed since not sure what other cultures view them as important. \n:Also, another way to tackle the problem is to say within each category the articles must be evenly divided between cultures. So, we can still have extremely important topics for a specific region. So, within Musicians the 21 articles must cover the 6 cultural regions. (3 or 4 Western musicians, 3 or 4 Asian musician, etc). --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 19:19, 11 April 2014 (UTC)\nI think that's quite an interesting idea. Bearing in mind that we are talking about suggestions for different languages we could go for away of linking languages to different cultures. Then each culture could have its own list of important pages, with a way of then generating a more global list on the basis of frequency of appearance in these different lists. This would mean that no-one would necessarily face the daunting task of wondering how popular Mahler is in Africa, unless they had elected to work on that culture. Secondly, for the list to work as a prompt, it could be made more meaningful, so that an African language such as [[w:ee:Axa do \u014ag\u0254|E\u028begbe]] would have one list geared principally around African culture, and with a smaller global list emerging in addition. We should also bear in mind that the list is most useful to those languages with the least articles.[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 20:35, 11 April 2014 (UTC)\n:Just to clarify my suggestion is not to have a six lists per culture. But to have one list of 1000 articles that evenly covers the six cultures. The complaints about the existing list are almost without fail about the 120 biography articles which make up list. The remain 880 articles would probably be in all six lists if you went that direction. (eg. [[w:Electricity|Electricity]] is important to every culture). But six completely different lists is a valid idea. I just would have it be a parallel project and not a replacement for this list. Sort of like the [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded]], you could have [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/African]], [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Western]], etc. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 07:04, 12 April 2014 (UTC)\nThat's a good point about the biography articles. I think perhaps that is where the contentious points arise. Presumably there is no reason to have 1000 articles except that it relates to the number of fingers most people have. Perhaps we could have [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Biographies]] which could them break down to the different cultures. Perhaps we could look at the state of play on some of the small wikis?[[User:Leutha|Leutha]] ([[User talk:Leutha|talk]]) 20:46, 12 April 2014 (UTC)\n: What is Black musician?

There are very few biographies in this group. We must remember that although in Europe religion is not so important nowadays, it has been always the most important thing in the history &ndash; and still is for the most of the world (America, Africa, South Asia). For example, we should certainly add John Paul II &ndash; considering especially the lack of contemporary people in this category. He is more important that formerly present here Mother Teresa. What do You think? Let's discuss that, because this is an evident defect of this list.

John Paul II doesn't seem to have such a lasting reputation and is already being shadowed by the current superstar pope in public perception (at least that's my personal impression). Therefore, I do not feel that he deserves a place here. The problem is that most religious figures' importance is limited to their particular religion, while for example the importance of inventors or scientists is more universal. And we are trying to build a list that's as universal as possible. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 19:30, 5 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n::Hello! John Paul the Great is also widely recognizable. Of course, now we have another pope, so JP2 is in some sense in his shadow, but JP2 was even bigger superstar. And the impact of this person is not restricted only to one religion. He was the main leader of the whole christianity and worldwide religion in general. He was engaged so much in the ecumenical and interreligious dialogue. He was also a political leader who has made the communism collapse. He is considered as well the greatest Pole ever, more than Chopin, Copernicus and Curie, who are listed here. Thus he has become a saint in few years' time, one of the fastest record ever.

There are five big religions, accounting ~90% of the world's population. The articles Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Krishna (or Trimurti) and Confucius could represent all of them. Once we included more than one figure per religion, this section became unbalanced. There is also a section \"Religion\", with 25 more articles, including at least one for each of the big religions (there is an article \"Catholic Church\" beside \"Christianity\").

Sociological fact is ([http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/u-s-catholics-key-data-from-pew-research/#attendmass reference]), for instance, that 17% of US Catholics never attend church worship (not so hard to find them after all, no?), and additional 41% only on a monthly or yearly basis. That leaves 41% regularly practicing Catholics for which we could say that religion is very important, although claiming that it's the most important thing in the life of every one of them is still a stretch. That means, extrapolating, less than 7% of human population to which your assessment of importance of Catholic figures would apply. And ''that'', dear Propositum, is thinking globally. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 17:59, 1 November 2014 (UTC)\n\n:I'm not insulting anyone; moreover, I'm avoiding it.

If someone doesn't attend church now it doesn't mean she/he hasn't been there '''at all''' during the whole life after Baptism, as You said. The Catholicism is the mainstream of the Christianity, which is the mainstream of the religion, which is the mainstream of the humankind.

So please start providing some credible arguments if you wish to continue this discussion.\n::PS: the distinction between \"never attending church\" and \"never having been there at all after baptism\" is superficial and irrelevant for the essence of my message - that religion is not so terribly important to quite a large proportion of people labelled as Catholics, contrary to your (unsupported, ergo POV) claims. Yes, religion is (still) important, that's why it's represented by all sorts of entries thoughout this list, from artists, thinkers and actual leaders to basic concepts and history.

It's pretty clear that not all that it's important for some group fits in here. For all those important articles not listed here we can always create a project in a particular Wikipedia (or even a multilanguage project, why not?) in order to improve the topic, e.g. Wiki Religion (see for instance Wiki Medicine which became a User Group). I don't agree to include more articles on Catholicism here, because there are many fields of knowledge to cover in an encyclopedia, and we simply shouldn't choose just one to list as \"articles every Wikipedia should have\". We expect every Wikipedia to be neutral (it's a pillar of our project) and general (not a thematic encyclopedia, dedicated to music, to a TV show, to sport teams, to religion, etc.). The articles you suggested here are indeed important, that's why they fit in Wikipedia (if they weren't, they could be deleted anytime), but they are all related to a same topic, aren't them? And you suggested articles from other topics to be replaced by them, do you see the impact of this change? Should we really diminish other sections in order to have more catholic biographies in this list? I don't think so. But as you said, Peter is as important as Paul, so if you want to replace one by the other, i'm fine to discuss it.

It's simply too narrow focus, however important you say Christianity is. Much more suitable for this list are entries like [[:en:Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]], who is universally regarded as one of the greatest artists in history, and has created mostly works with Catholic motifs, therefore he's also important to the largest, but non-universal religious denomination in question. As I said, there are lots of biographies and other articles like that scattered throughout this list, such as [[:en:Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[:en:Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], [[:en:St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], [[:en:Crusades|crusades]], etc., etc. So it's definitely not true that Catholicism is underrepresented. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 14:14, 9 November 2014 (UTC)\n\n::::::That's a real pity, but You are wrong.

In itself I think this list is a good idea, to stimulate Wikipedias to offer readers useful information on key topics. However, Til Eulenspiegel (the proprietor of amwiki) uses this as a game to score points in. He does this by making (sub)minimum pages at amwiki (of very few words, and less content) and trying to move these into the Wikidata items that will give him the maximum score. To maximize the score of his own amwiki (he is the bureaucrat, admin, and main, almost sole user) he is willing to cause any amount of damage at Wikidata.\n:::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons to link to the items on the fruits (/products): firstly, if the topic is say, tomato, why not take this at face value and link to the item on the tomato. Secondly, if the purpose is to have pages on, say, the tomato or the potato, then users should be encouraged to make pages on the tomato or the potato, and not necessarily on the plants that produce them. Most users who will start out on a page on the tomato or the potato will describe what they know, namely the tomato or the potato. These are big enough topics, and plenty of books have been written about them. So the beginners will profit from having the entries in the list linked to the items that the titles used here say they should be linked to. In addition, Wikipedias may make pages on the plant, which is a notable topic, but with nothing like the appeal that the tomato itself has. Of course it is also possible to make pages on both the plant and the product, but the TLDR stage will loom soon, and a split will begin to suggest itself. Actually, there are not just these two topics, but there is also the horticultural/agricultural aspect, a topic on which there also is (very) extensive literature, but this is academic, since so far noboy seems to have started separate Wikipedia pages on these topics. - [[User:Brya|Brya]] ([[User talk:Brya|talk]]) 17:09, 13 October 2017 (UTC)\n::::P.S no such thing as \"taxons\" exists.

Expandability may indeed be an indicator of a topic importance but not necessarily - a lot of articles on pop stars can easily be inflated to hundreds of Kb but this does not make these topics highly important.\n** You also do not take into consideration the role of certain sports in the human culture. Greco-Roman wrestling is a cultural staple being a recognized link between classic Olympics and modern sport, and ball games have quite a separate notability from ball since they evolved as first team sports in human history in countries all around the globe, including ancient China and pre-Columbian America. \n** There is, on the other hand, such aspect as previously identified notability. It is rather inconceivable that an actually important topic would in 15 years get a separate coverage in just 13 Wikipedias (I am specifically talking about [[d:Q2369170|Underwater sports]]).\n** I tend to agree that Petanque and Rugby league may be redundant on a global scale, and Nordic skiing perhaps does not have enough own weight to be kept in the list where both Skiing and Ski are already included, but then why do we need two separate articles about cue sports and snooker? Why not just one of them?\n** As I've mentioned in our previous discussion, Self-defence routinely described across Wikipedias not as a variation of sport but rather as a legal concept. So its notability in a legal sense can be discussed separately but it clearly does not belong to the sports list. And I also doubt the necessity of adding Combat sport to a list where Martial arts are already included.\n** To sum things up: I tend to agree that there are three, maybe four redundant items ([[d:Q10962|Rugby league]], [[d:Q189317|Petanque]], [[d:Q216613|Nordic skiing]], and possibly [[d:Q327223|Freestyle wrestling]] - although in the last case I just may not know enough to assess its true value). And I agree that the list can probably benefit from adding [[d:Q309162|Extreme sport]], [[d:Q1085001|Ballroom dance]] (although why should it be in the sports section and not in [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded/Arts|Arts]]? You can actually see in the enWiki article that it is much more than just sport), and perhaps [[d:Q644628|Air sports]]. All other exclusions/additions do not seem to me substantiated enough. I'd also really like to hear opinions of a couple more experienced Meta editors, such as {{u|Yerpo}}, {{u|Tximitx}} or {{u|Boivie}}. --[[User:Deinocheirus|Deinocheirus]] ([[User talk:Deinocheirus|talk]]) 00:12, 3 May 2019 (UTC)\n:::I think it's good that [[User:Maqivi|Maqivi]] is trying to improve the list, because there is lots of room for improvements. And I think it's good that [[User:Deinocheirus|Deinocheirus]] is reviewing the changes so that we get a wider perspective of what items are best for the list. Unfortunately I don't have the time to review the items in question here myself, but I agree with [[User:Deinocheirus|Deinocheirus]] that if an item only exists in a few Wikipedias (like 13), it's probably an indication of that it's not a very notable topic.

For instance, Ball games that we discussed previously are important but Soccer is definitely more so. Swimming is more important than Aquatic sports, etc. Same here: Underwater sports is a somewhat artificial concept mechanically uniting several quite different types of sport (none of which is actually very popular), and thus receives less attention in professional literature.

I agree with the appraisals of {{u|Deinocheirus}}. However, in the case of dance, it is necessary to differentiate between [[:d:Q1085001|ballroom dance]] and [[:d:Q738622|dancesport]]. The ballroom dance began as a social act, which subsequently has been evolving towards the artistic aspect. However, the dance competitions that we know and that have made it popular refer to the dancesport, which although based on ballroom dance, is a much more restricted discipline, where technique over art prevails. If you want to include dance as a sport discipline, it should be dancesport and not ballroom dance. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 14:26, 6 May 2019 (UTC)", "bytes": 11558, "sha1": "1rw05lb9f8lt8w16v1dnmlajrw3t7t1", "parent_id": 21116191, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "deleted": {"text": false, "comment": false, "user": false}}

[[:d:Q486902|Mathematical model]] looks ''much'' more reasonable to me - it is indeed a vast and crucial aspect of mathematics. As for mathematical physics as its part - if you suggest to eliminate some elements in the list because they represent just a portion of more notable and well-known concept, then there is no reason whatsoever to add similarly specific instances of other well-known concept. Same goes for the aspects of Applied math - why should we have a bunch of topics on this one and not on Field theory? If you wish to replace some elements with others there should be some sort of analysis, not just gut feelings. For example, while Mathematical physics, Econometrics and Mathematical economics appear in the 2002 ''Encyclopaedia of Mathematics'', mathematical finance does not.

In many languages, the article for \"arithmetics\" seems to be merely a collection of the description of the four basic arithmetics. Some of the major divisions may be worth keeping, but we should care about how the article should look like and examine whether we really need that content. I also think this list should provide a list of good sample points of wikipedia, rather than the complete coverage of the basic mathematics.\n::: Parallel postulate.

[g] Note that the Wikidata item is about the \"elementary branch of mathematics\", not just the four operations. If the existing Wikiepdia articles are so limited, they need expanding. As for \"complete coverage of the basic mathematics\", that is clearly not what this list is aiming for, nor is that even a realistic goal. I see it more as a collection of major topics that can serve to point out (as they are expanded and wikified) what other articles are worth writing. Also, most of them are the kinds of articles that would naturally split off into more specific, related articles as they develop. In other words, they serve as \"seeds\" that can help a small Wikipedia to grow.

At the same time, [[:en:Catholicism]] describes one of the [[en:Four Marks of the Church]], which applies to most christian churches, and starts with a caveat: ''\"This sense is to be distinguished from the use of these words to refer to the Roman Catholic Church...\"''\n\nIn other languages -- and particularly in ruwiki, where I'm coming from -- the two meanings of Catholicism are expressed with different terms. Thus, the Russian interwiki of [[:en:Catholicism]] came to describe the doctrine of the [Roman] Catholic Church; the Russian interwiki of [[:en:Catholic Church]] -- the church itself and its organisation; and a third article is for the catholicity as one of the [[en:Four Marks of the Church]].\n\nNow, our question is, how can we align that with WP:HAVE? Naturally, we want our main article on [Roman] Catholicism to be on the list; the Russian article on Catholic Church is essentially a subarticle of Catholicism. At the same time, we want to preserve the interwiki between [[:en:Catholic Church]] and its Russian counterpart, since the subjects (though not the scope) of the two articles are the same.\n\nLooking at wikidata, [[d:Q1841|Catholicism]] \"has parts\" [[d:Q9592|Catholic Church]] and [[d:Q5169816|Old Catholic Church]], but none of the other catholic churches in the sense of the [[en:Four Marks of the Church]] -- in particular, not [[:en:Orthodox Catholic Church]]. This seems to imply that Q1841 \"Catholicism\" stands for the second meaning of the term, i.e. the doctrine of the [Roman] Catholic Church, -- and not the one described at [[:en:Catholicism]]. I don't know if there exists a wikidata entry for the other meaning of catholicity.\n\nSo, the source of our confusion is: there are three subjects, loosely mapped to two enwiki articles. One of the three merits an entry on WP:HAVE -- the religious doctrine; but it's not the main subject of its enwiki article. How can all this be handled? --[[Special:Contributions/146.200.13.17|146.200.13.17]] 23:58, 13 March 2016 (UTC)\n\n== [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have#Philosophers and social scientists|Philosophers and social scientists]]: Martin Heidegger ==\n\nHello.

With important entries like [[:en:Ibn Battuta|Ibn Battuta]], [[:en:Zheng He|Zheng He]] and the [[:en:Gupta Empire|Gupta Empire]], it is less anglo-centric and less euro-centric than most of these types of lists. Kudos to the creators for achieving that.  There are still some critical gaps though, and it will require some additional work to make the list truly global in nature. \nUnder ''History'', I suggest adding the following four topics:\n* '''[[:en:Mali Empire|Mali Empire]]''', the richest civilization during the 14th century, with extensive trade reaching three continents, and with a highly developed and sophisticated culture. In comparison, [[:en:Medieval Europe|Medieval Europe]] was at the time a stagnant backwater. \n* '''[[:en:Maya civilization|Maya]]''', one of the great early civilizations in the world, an independent inventor of writing and with sophisticated science and architecture.\n* '''[[:en:Inca|Inca]]''', the great civilization of South America, with direct or indirect reach over almost a whole continent\n* '''[[:en:Sumer|Sumer]]''', the cradle of western civilization. While Sumer is part of [[:en:Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], which is on the list, it definitely deserves its own entry.\n\nOf course, to add also means to subtract. I propose removing the [[:en:Hundred Years' War|Hundred Years' War]], the [[:en:Thirty Years' War|Thirty Years' War]], [[:en:the crusades|The crusades]] and the [[:en:Treaty of Versailles|Treaty of Versailles]]. These are all important events in European history, but they are not the most important and defining trends of European history, which are represented by the existing entries of [[:en:Medieval Europe|Medieval Europe]], [[:en:The Renaissance|The Renaissance]], the [[:en:Protestant Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] and [[:en:World War 1|World War 1]]. For example, the ''Hundred Years' War'' was a long lasting local skirmish between the French speaking lords of France and the French speaking lords of England, neither of which were of global importance at the time, and the ''Thirty Years' War'' was one of many violent periods in European history.  \n\nTo double check my own thoughts on this, I consulted [[:en:Felipe Fernandez-Armesto|Felipe Fernandez-Armesto]]s book ''Millenium: The history of the last 1000 years'', which attempts to take a truly global perspective on world history. The ''Maya'', ''Inca'' and ''Mali Empire'' all have several pages devoted to them, while the ''Hundred Years' War'' is not mentioned at all, the ''Thirty Years' War'' is given a couple of paragraphs, and the ''Treaty of Versailles'' is briefly mentioned in the chapter on the First World War. The Crusades get almost the same amount of coverage as the ''Maya'' and the ''Inca'', but considerable less that the ''Mali Empire''. (''Sumer'' is older than 1000 years so it falls outside the scope of the book).\n\nIn summary, in order to make the list more global and less euro-centric, my suggestions are to include: \n* The ''Mali Empire'' instead of the ''Hundred Years' War''\n* The ''Maya'' instead of the ''Thirty Years' War''\n* The ''Inca'' instead of the ''Treaty of Versailles'', and \n* ''Sumer'' instead of ''The Crusades''. \nLooking forward to hear what others think.

[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 11:31, 27 May 2017 (UTC)\n\n: I'm inclined to agree with these arguments, except perhaps regarding the crusades which impacted the wider region (Europe, Middle East, North Africa) and two civilizations. Maybe we could postpone including either [[:en:Maya civilization|Maya]] or [[:en:Inca|Inca]] until a better alternative to replace is found. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 07:47, 30 May 2017 (UTC)\n::Yes, that sounds like a better approach, to instead remove something from a different category.

A search of \"Esperanto\" via Google gets at least 100 million results. Just to count the number of speakers is not enough to understand the special role of this language.

Then people learned Esperanto and are still learning Esperanto and an international language community of a new kind was created and is expanding more and more. This community developed its own culture with books and songs etc., being a supranational community. This is something quite different from English.

The list should contain zoology and genetics as well, since it is absurd that the list contains botany but not these two articles. RNA, Gene and heredity should be included as well.

While I was trying to have this reflected in Wikidata, {{ping|Succu}} ([[d:User:Succu|d:]]) was disputing my edits [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Talk:Q500]. If I understand his very brief remarks correctly, he is convinced that this list should rather reference the fruit {{Q|1093742}} (class: {{Data|item=Q1093742|property=P279}}), but seems not to bother to do anything about it, so let me play proxy here for his request: '''{{ping|Succu}} asks to replace Lemon(-tree) (Q500) with Lemon(-fruit) (Q1093742)'''. See also [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive/2017/04#Brya's_editing]\n\nThe '''same issue also applies to {{Q|11006}}''' (listed here as a taxon under '''foodstuffs'''/'''fruit''' as '''Soybean'''), but I couldn't find a separate article or wd-item for its fruit/bean.\n\nFollowing his request, we would consequently replace the plants with the fruits (lemon for now) and end up with no english (or simple) articles for it. I find this problematic due to the nature of this list, but it is certainly possible. E.g. in german we can live with those holes as we include see-also-notes with them [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Artikel,_die_es_in_allen_Wikipedias_geben_sollte#Lebensmittel_(31_Artikel)]. But whoever wants to track adoption of this list automatically will have to deal with it (already).\n\n{{Q|500}} has far more sitelinks than {{Q|1093742}} 138 vs 25. \n* The taxon-item has sitelinks to simple and german talking about fruit and taxon, englisch says it's about the fruit, but actually also is about both. \n* The fruit-item has no sitelinks to english, no german, no chinese...\n\nAs a general rule, we could keep Wikidata-Items for taxons on this list as long as there are no separare Wikidata-Items for their fruits. Thus soybean would be replaced as well, once we find the fuit item.\n\nMy intend here is to seek clarification and as a German could also live without a sitelink to english, especially as lemon only appears there in the [[en:Wikipedia:Vital_articles/Expanded/Biology_and_health_sciences#Edible_fruits_(50_articles)|expanded list]] (level 4, 10.000 articles). --[[User:Aeroid|Aeroid]] ([[User talk:Aeroid|talk]]) 12:49, 4 March 2018 (UTC)\n\n\nI'd like to participate in this discussion. My edition was reverted when I changed {{Q|500}} for {{Q|1093742}} and I'm going to explain why I think it might be in that way. Firstly, let's take a look to this list. In Foodstuffs, part 7 is about fruits ({{Q|1364}}), defined here in wikidata as a \"part of a flowering plant\" but I prefer the more complete definition in the english wikipedia: \"a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants\". Taking in account these definitions, it seems to be clear that '''the fruit is not the whole plant or tree'''. Now, let's take a look to the fruits mentioned in this part 7 and their definitions in the linked pages in wikidata: {{Q|89}} \"fruit of the apple tree\", {{Q|503}} \"fruit\", {{Q|10978}} \"the fruit, use Q191019 for the genus, use Q30046 for the species\", {{Q|11006}} \"species of plant\", {{Q|500}} \"nothospecies of plant (for lemon use Q1093742)\" and {{Q|11009}} \"edible seed (with or without the rest of the fruit)\". We can see that 4 out of 6 linked pages in wikidata talk about fruit (it could be doubtful \"nut\", but an extended definition of fruit is \"any '''plant product''' useful to man, including grain, vegetables, etc\" or \"'''any edible''' part of a plant\", but never the whole plant). As a conclusion, in my opinion, there are two mistakes concerning to \"soybean\" (in this list, it might be only the grain of the plant) and \"lemon\" (clearly concerning to {{Q|1093742}}). I think that {{Q|500}} has far more sitelinks than {{Q|1093742}} is not a strong reason to maintain {{Q|500}} because a repeated mistake (in my modest opinion, of course) doesn't make it true. Most of the languages that sounds, more or less, familiar to me, make the difference between the fruit and the fruit tree: lemon and lemon tree (english), lim\u00f3n and limonero (spanish), citron and citronnier (french), zitrone and zitronenbaum (german), limao and limoeiro (portuguese), lim\u00f3n and limoeiro (galician), llimona and llimoner (catalan), limone and (albero di) limone (italian); but only two (french and galician) have a page for everyone. The other have only one page for the lemon tree or two pages, being one a redirection to the other. On the contrary, for example, {{Q|10978}} and {{Q|30046}} have their own page on everyone of the mentioned wikis. Why all of these wikis have different pages for \"grape\" and \"grape vine\" but not for \"lemon\" and \"lemon tree\"? That seems not to be so coherent.

To make room for Canton, I would remove [[:en:Vatican City|Vatican City]]. Both [[:en:Rome|Rome]] and the [[:en:Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] are on the list, which is good, and I do not think we need the Vatican City as well.\n\nAs a very minor item, one could also consider moving the city-state of [[:en:Singapore|Singapore]] from the list of countries to the list of cities. While the city and the country are the same, as a city Singapore is of truly global importance, but as a country it is rather small and less important than for example neighboring Malaysia. \n\n===Countries===\nTo make the list of countries more global in nature, I would add\n#The [[:en:Phillippines|Phillippines]], with over 100 million people it is the largest country not currently on the list\n#[[:en:Colombia|Colombia]], with 49 million people, one of the major countries in South America\n#[[:en:Kenya|Kenya]], with 47 million people, one of the major countries in Africa\n#[[:en:Syria|Syria]], with 18 million people, and historically a very important country.\n#[[:en:Morocco|Morocco]], with 34 million people, a culturally and historically important country in both Africa and in the Arab world\n#[[:en:Yemen|Yemen]], with 27 million people, also historically very important\n#[[:en:Guatemala|Guatemala]], with 16 million people, which is both historically and currently the most important country in Central America.\nWhat seven items do we then remove?

Regarding Austria, I rather keep [[:en:Vienna|Vienna]] on the list, for its historical and cultural importance. With two more to go, it is hard to find other candidate countries to remove.

It is also questionable if we need to have (vii) [[:en:Ocean|Ocean]] on the list since we already have [[:en:Sea|Sea]]. It is linguistically a little tricky though, as these have slightly different meaning in English (Sea can mean either part of an ocean or the collection of all oceans), while most languages have a word that are commonly used for all three concepts, such as ''mar'' in Spanish, ''hav'' in Norweigian, and ''Meer'' in German, even though some also use an ocean equivalent word as a less used specialty term.\n\n===Islands===\nWhile the list includes the longest rivers, the tallest mountain, the biggest lakes, all the oceans and the most extensive dessert, the biggest island is missing.

archival discussion can help us today. Based on the historical comments, I think there must have been some Divine intervention that has kept \"Vatican City\" on the list. [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 02:25, 25 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n: Most of the proposals are reasonable (I'm not 100% convinced about some of the newly proposed countries). I would consider replacing Ocean/Sea with [[:en:World Ocean]] - anyway most of the content of the 2 articles is about the general concept. --[[User:Nk|Nk]] ([[User talk:Nk|talk]]) 14:53, 25 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n::In general I agree with the suggested changes, but with some nuances:\n::* In the list of countries, [[:en:Myanmar|Myanmar]], [[:en:Malaysia|Malaysia]] and [[:en:Peru|Peru]] should also be included. Peru is more important than [[:en:Guatemala|Guatemala]], both in size and history. As a Central American country, Cuba is included, which is smaller than Guatemala although I do not know if it is of more interest. As there is limited space to include countries, I would choose one or the other.\n::* In cities I would remove [[:en:Washington D.C.|Washington DC]]. The only relevant reason to include that city is that it is the capital of United States, but is it enough? If being the capital of an important country is enough to be included in the list, then [[:en:Bras\u00edlia|Bras\u00edlia]] should also be included, which is larger. Honestly, I do not think that reason is enough, and neither by size nor importance do I see reasons to maintain it.\n::* I see no reason to change Singapore from \"countries\" to \"cities\" only because as a country it is small. In general it is considered a country (even if it is a city-state), which also has a special relevance in Asia. I would keep it as such.\n::* I see no reason to include Greenland. Although we include it as an island, the Wikipedias will treat it as a country.\n::* I see no reason to eliminate Ocean. Although sea and ocean may be similar, I believe that all languages \u200b\u200bhave a different term for both concepts, so in all languages \u200b\u200bthere is therefore a difference in the concept. If there was a language in which it was not, we could study the case, but otherwise I see no reason to eliminate any.\n::Therefore, of the 7 countries that you propose, I would remove Guatemala and I would include the 3 that I have indicated, with which we would have 9 countries to add.\n::In addition to the indicated cities and countries for remove, I would also remove Washington DC, so we have 6 spaces. In seas I would add article [[:en:Seven Seas|Seven Seas]] (very poor article in English for a very important historical denomination) and remove the seas from that list (Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Mediterranean Sea) and also the North Sea. In this way we have 3 more spaces, with a total of 9 spaces for the indicated countries. The doubt could be with the [[:en:Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean Sea]], which is an important sea, but I think it would be covered by the article of Seven Seas. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 22:59, 25 March 2019 (UTC)\n::: [[:en:Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean Sea]] is one of the most important civilizational area (Roman Empire, Carthage, Greece, Egypt...), an economic center (from Antiquity to nowadays) and a major geopolitical issue (Suez channel, maritime roads, border between North and South countries, border between several big religions, US/NATO/Russian presence...). AMHO, its presence is then expected in the list and I disagree with its removal.  --[[User:Nicolas Eynaud|Nicolas Eynaud]] ([[User talk:Nicolas Eynaud|talk]]) 11:53, 13 April 2019 (UTC)\n:::: I agree with Nicholas about the Mediterranean. [[:en:Seven Seas|Seven Seas]], on the other hand, is a vague and historically shifting concept, much overlapping with [[:en:World Ocean|World Ocean]], so not very relevant. \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 07:13, 14 April 2019 (UTC)\n\n=== Comments 2 ===\n\nComments about the different proposals :\n* {{support}} Replace Bogota with Colombia : I think it's a good idea. Even if Bogoto is a major city, Colombia is one of the most important regional in South America and, to me, the country is more important than its capital.\n* {{support}} Replace Nairobi with Kenya : for the same reasons (Kenya is one of the regional power in East Africa).\n\n* {{oppose}} Remove Austria but {{support} Remove Viena : AMHO, Austria is the heir Austria-Hungary which was a major power in Europe during centuries and an important cultural center. AMHO, keeping Austria will allow to remove Viena (which is the center of Austrian culture) and to justify easily the absence of Austria-Hungary.\n* {{oppose}} Remove Swiss : Swiss is of course not a very populated area but the country has an important politic and economic influence.\n* {{support}} Remove Vatican City : AMHO, the proposal is right : Vatican is included in Catholic Church.\n* {{support}} Remove New Zealand : AMHO, the country is not a regional power in Oceania (it's Australia) and its cultural and economic influence is limited.\n* {{support}} Include Song Dynasty which is missing despite its importance in Chinese History.\n* {{support}} Include Yemen and Syria as there are historical region.\n\n* {{support}} Remove Black Sea, Caspian Sea and North Sea : there are important geopolitical and economic theatres but we can consider others elements (as major countries) are more important.\n* {{support}} Then include Phillippines (a demographic and regional power), Morocco (a regional power with an important cultural and historical influences) and Peru (major cultural importance in South America).\n\n* {{oppose}} Remove Arctic Ocean as it is one of the major ocean and an important region (future crude oil production area ? geopolitical issue between USA and Russia...). To me, Greeland seems to be included in Arctic Ocean (at least in the current list).\n* {{oppose}} Remove Mediterranean Sea (as explained).\n\n* {{oppose}} Include Seven Seas in the list : the concept was important during Middle Ages but, AMHO, it is just now an historical curiosity. Its presence in the list is then not expected.\n--[[User:Nicolas Eynaud|Nicolas Eynaud]] ([[User talk:Nicolas Eynaud|talk]]) 07:49, 15 April 2019 (UTC)\n\n{{comment}} Austria is not the heir Austria-Hungary. This empire was dissolved in several states, Austria being one of them, but not the heir. That it is preferred to keep Austria instead of Vienna is something else (which I do not share), but not because he was the heir Austria-Hungary, since it is not. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 10:41, 15 April 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Vaccine ==\n\nI am surprised to see that this list does not include the vaccine as one of the most important articles, that it should even be in bold. The vaccine is considered the most important invention of modern medicine and the medicine that has saved the most lives.\n\nInstead, I propose to withdraw the \"headache\", which seems to me a minor element to include it in the list of the most important.\n\nAs for the articles in bold, I think the \"vaccine\" is important enough to include it in this way, eliminating the \"virus\" from the list in bold. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 12:57, 21 March 2019 (UTC)\n: Thank you [[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] for this important suggestion. I agree that \"vaccine\" should be added, and that it can be bolded instead of \"virus\". What to remove is a little bit more of a headache. Considering the importance of medicine/health, the section is rather short. Can we remove something from a different section? How about \"Machine gun\", \"Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\", \"Le Corbusier\", \"Michael Faraday\", \"Commonwealth of Independent States\" or \"Lipid\"? Other suggestions? [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 22:25, 21 March 2019 (UTC)\n::I have no objection to deleting an article from another section. Of those proposed, \"Commonwealth of Independent States\" I don't consider it as relevant enough. There are even more important political and commercial blocs that aren't on the list. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 22:56, 21 March 2019 (UTC)\n\nI fully agree on the importance of this topic. But, as usual, a dilemma can't be avoided - should we include {{q|134808}} or {{q|192995}} as a broader topic? \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 08:10, 22 March 2019 (UTC)\n:Although \"vaccination\" is important, from the encyclopedic point of view, what is important is the vaccine. Without it, vaccination would not exist. Therefore, I maintain that \"vaccine\" should be included as the relevant article. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 12:00, 22 March 2019 (UTC)\n::Good question [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]]. I agree with [[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] that \"Vaccine\" is the better choice. It also fits with other entries, as we have \"Food\" instead of \"Eating\", \"Agriculture\" instead of \"Farming\", \"Bicycle\" instead of \"Cycling\", \"Milk\" instead of \"Milking\", \"Song\" instead of \"Singing\", \"Antibiotic\" instead of \"???\", etc. [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 19:41, 22 March 2019 (UTC)\n\nI'm a novice here and I don't know how to proceed with the change of the articles in the list. Do I have to make the change? Is someone responsible? Are they done every so often and we have to wait? I appreciate the clarifications. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 17:03, 24 March 2019 (UTC)\n:Anyone can do it. I would wait a week to give others more opportunity to comment. As for timing, there is a wish not to change the list just before the [[List of Wikipedias by sample of articles|ranking]] is updated. [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 23:53, 24 March 2019 (UTC)\n::All right. I will wait until the ranking is updated to make the change. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 13:10, 25 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Literature ==\n\nHello, without bothering anyone, I wonder if the literature section has ever been discussed. The added articles are good, but I think it would be more enriching if there were representation of other cultures, because most of the added works are Asian. What do you think?. --[[User:Rodelar|Rodelar]] ([[User talk:Rodelar|talk]]) 15:33, 23 March 2019 (UTC)\n: Good observation [[User:Rodelar|Rodelar]]. All eight works of literature are from Asia, including the [[:en:Iliad|Iliad]]. Except for [[:en:Dream of the Red Chamber|Dream of the Red Chamber]], all of them are also ancient literature, while Roman literature as well as modern literature from the last 800 years are covered under the authors in the biography section. I think there are two issues:\n#It is hard to make room for both the authors and their major work. Is it then better to include Dante or ''Devine Comedy''? Tolstoy or ''War and Peace''? Shikibu or ''Tale of Genji''? Cervantes or ''Don Quixote''? Shakespeare or ''Hamlet''? Cao Xueqin or ''Dream of the Red Chamber''? Virgil or ''Aeneid''? Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez or ''One hundred years of solitude''? etc...  Should we replace some of the authors with their books or vice versa? \n#For a more global perspective on ancient literature, what could be added? [[:en:Kebra Nagast|Kebra Nagast]]? [[:en:Beowulf|Beowulf]]? [[:en:Popul Vuh|Popul Vuh]]? the [[:en:Icelandic Sagas|Icelandic Sagas]]? [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 20:32, 23 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n:::[[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]], about the observations indicated, I think we have to differentiate each case. For example, Cervantes is a writer recognized especially for his work ''Don Quixote'', but as a writer he is not a relevant writer, since he does not have other works that are especially relevant. I am spanish, and I can affirm that there are many spanish writers and other spanish-speaking countries that are much more important. But, of course, there is no doubt that his work ''Don Quixote'' is the most important work of literature in spanish and one of the most important and recognized in the world. In this case, the work surpasses the author, so I think it is more relevant to include his work in the list instead of the author. As shown, the article in es.wiki of ''Don Quixote'' is twice the size of Cervantes.\n:::Different is the case of, for example, Shakespeare or Jules Verne, whose set of works are practically classics of universal literature. In this case I think it's better to include the authors.\n:::After these explanations, about the indicated authors I would make the following changes:\n:::* I would keep the authors Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Virgil and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, because I think they stand out more for their complete work than for a specific title.\n:::* I would include the works ''Don Quixote'', ''Devine Comedy'', ''Tale of Genji'' and ''Dream of the Red Chamber'', replacing their authors, because they are works of universal literature that stand out over their authors (in my opinion).\n:::In authors I would include Jules Verne, which I consider an important reference. In substitution, can eliminate the article of \"machine gun\", which I think is not a particularly remarkable invention.\n::: On ancient literature, some titles: ''[[:en:Beowulf|Beowulf]], the [[:en:Icelandic Sagas|Icelandic Sagas]], [[:en:Cantar de Mio Cid|Cantar de Mio Cid]], [[:en:Nibelungenlied|Nibelungenlied]] ''or'' [[:en:The Travels of Marco Polo|The Travels of Marco Polo]]''. The importance of the works or what articles to eliminate, I leave it at the discretion of others. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 18:33, 24 March 2019 (UTC)\n::::[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]]: Thank you for your very thoughtful comments. I like your thinking about author/work. [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 23:53, 24 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n:::::I agree with Tximitx in including ''Don Quixote'', ''Devine Comedy'', ''Tale of Genji'' and ''Dream of the Red Chamber'' as works in lieu of authors. Also, the inclusion of Jules Verne instead of machine gun. Among the ancient literature, I find significant the ''Icelandic Sagas'', ''Popul Vuh'' and ''The Travels of Marco Polo''. --[[User:Rodelar|Rodelar]] ([[User talk:Rodelar|talk]]) 23:57, 24 March 2019 (UTC)\n:::About Marco Polo, I hadn't realized that he was already included as an explorer. In this case, I don't know if it is better to include the person or the book. I don't find necessary is to include both. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 21:04, 25 March 2019 (UTC)\n::::Agree with [[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] to include ''Don Quixote'' and ''Devine Comedy'' instead of their authors, as is already the case for ''Tale of Genji'' and ''Dream of the Red Chamber''. Thanks for pointing out that ''Marco Polo'' is already on the list, which I find sufficient and more natural to include than ''The Travels of Marco Polo''. For ancient literature, I agree with [[User:Rodelar|Rodelar]]'s selection of ''Popul Vuh'' and the ''Icelandic Sagas'', the latter being more extensive and culturally reflective than ''Beowulf'' or ''Nibelungenlied'', the other ancient Germanic literature mentioned. What can we remove to make room for these two? The only instance of having both a literary work and its author on the list is the ''Iliad'' and ''Homer'', and I suggest we keep the former and remove the latter as it is not certain that ''Homer'' existed and who actually wrote the ''Iliad''. Two other potential options for removal are ''phoneme'' and ''syllable''. [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 12:10, 26 March 2019 (UTC)\n:::::I agree with [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] in everything expressed. Also in keep ''Iliad'' and remove ''Homer''. Between ''phoneme'' and ''syllable'', the phoneme is important, since it is the representation of the sound that the words would have. However, the syllable is the division of the word according to the phonemes. Therefore, it would keep ''phoneme'' and remove ''syllable''.\n:::::By the way, ''Homer'' is in bold, and I don't think that ''Iliad'' should be (yes ''Don Quixote'' and ''Divine Comedy'' by Cervantes and Dante). What is put in bold by ''Homer''? Maybe ''Novel''? Another biography? Bearing in mind that several writers are removed in bold from Biography, I suggest including ''Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez'', who is considered one of the best writers in history. It may also be that my preference is influenced because my native language is Spanish. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 12:52, 26 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Biography section ==\n\n[[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]]: You are both a long-time and a very thoughtful participant in these list discussions. What is the thinking behind having a separate ''biography'' section rather than including ''authors'' in the ''language and literature'' section, ''scientists'' in the ''science'' section, ''musicians'' in the ''music'' section, ''explorers'' in the ''geography'' section, etc? Was this a conscious decision or it just happened that way? [[User:Martinogk|Martinogk]] ([[User talk:Martinogk|talk]]) 12:29, 26 March 2019 (UTC)\n:The biography section was there from the first day this list was being created. I [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have&diff=prev&oldid=1406381 tried spreading the biographies] 10 years ago. But it was [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have&diff=1467058&oldid=1466690 reverted] two months later. I can't find anything on [[Talk:List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Archives/2009#Biographies|the talk page]] about why it was reverted. [[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 10:00, 27 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n:The best answer I have is also something along the line of \"that's how it's always been done\".

[[User:Boivie|Boivie]] ([[User talk:Boivie|talk]]) 09:30, 3 April 2019 (UTC)\n:::I don't consider it a good idea. I don't think mixing biographies with other articles is better than the current way. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 12:14, 5 April 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Elephant ==\n\nThe item ''elephant'' presents problems in some languages, specifically in those that, like Spanish, use exclusively the scientific classification of species to create articles. In this case ''elephant'' refers to a group of species that doesn't have a scientific classification as a group (they are several different species). The family they belong to (''[[:en:Elephantidae|Elephantidae]]'') also includes mammoths, but there is no scientific group for elephants alone. I don't doubt the importance of the elephants, but the selected items shouldn't impose a structure in the languages on the articles to be included. In this case I suggest as an alternative to include ''[[:en:marine mammal|marine mammal]]'', which are more important than elephants. Within this item would be ''whales, dolphins and porpoises'', which would be keep. --[[User:Tximitx|Tximitx]] ([[User talk:Tximitx|talk]]) 13:15, 26 March 2019 (UTC)\n:+1. --[[User:Maqivi|Maqivi]] ([[User talk:Maqivi|talk]]) 19:00, 26 March 2019 (UTC)\n\n:We made a dubious change from [[en:Whale|Whale]] to [[en:Cetacea|Cetacea]] a while back because there wasn't a Swedish word for whale. IMHO, a core article's purpose is to link to other articles and a biological classification doesn't really do that. For example, the \"Whale\" concept links to \"Whaling\", \"Save the Whales\", \"Moby Dick\", \"Jonah and the Whale\". I think this change is a similar situation. Would you link \"Elephantidae\" to what Hannibal rode through the Alps. So, don't really agree on this. But you do have precedence on your side so am neutral on this. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 04:02, 5 April 2019 (UTC)\n::I agree in part with your opinion, but I'm not proposing to change \"Elephant\" to \"Elephantidae\". I'm proposing remove \"Elephant\" and add \"marine mammals\", which is also important and allows link other items.

However, for most languages, Americas is a single continent, and the North/South division is political, and not geographical. In fact, the normal thing in almost all languages \u200b\u200bis to use North/Central/South America as a political division of a single continent, not including Central America as part of North America. It is enough to see the [[:d:Q49|articles linked in Wikidata to North America]] to realize that there is no uniform criterion and in most cases they don't refer to the subcontinent. Some only include United States and Canada; others add to Mexico, and only a few add Central America. International organizations such as UN, IOC, etc., also recognize Americas as a single continent, this being the most globally accepted meaning. I don't find a reason to maintain the sense of the english language that is a minority and that in most languages \u200b\u200bis a political concept and not a geographical. I propose to eliminate items from North and South America as continents and to include only Americas as a single continent, since this is the most universally accepted meaning.\n\nIn the free space, I realize that there is not an element as important as [[w:Water|Water]], essential for life. I propose to include it also with bold. I don't know in which section to include it, since as a chemical element it is not an important element, but it is in other scientific disciplines.

We already have \"[[w:en:animation|animation]]\". There should be sufficient information on anime within the animation article, right? It seems just a little too specific for this list. Checking the archives shows a bit more talk about anime's worthiness, too. I suggest replacing it with \"[[w:en:video game|video game]]\"([[d:Q7889|Q7889]]), a topic that by contrast seems too broad for its containing article, \"[[w:en:game|game]]\". There's incredible variation within video games, and, unlike most other kinds of game, the video game is often considered an emerging art medium.

[[User:Interstellarity|Interstellarity]] ([[User talk:Interstellarity|talk]]) 12:26, 15 December 2020 (UTC)\n::::{{ping|Interstellarity}} Obviously it's important to cover women on the English list - i've just been on the list for years and know none would likely pass as people arent radical there and tend to not consider anything out of the norm, someone like Cai Lun was rejected - for example. The difference is if we're recommending (or forcing) different wikipedias to create articles based off this list - we should make sure we include articles from every main area (African culture, Asian culture, European culture) The English list people skate by on a technicality - for example Wagner being seen as more important to cover on a English encyclopedia rather than Saladin due to being more important to \"western civilization\". (despite the crusades being inevitably more important than opera). Here we don't focus (we do but should not) on western civilization, we should try and cover every civilization. Or in simpler terms noone on the English list will swap Bach, Mozart, Beethoven or Wagner for Piaf, Fela Kuti, Teresa Teng or Umm Kulthum - but when we list Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Dietrich we have room to swap them on this one, do you see how it's obvious a Malay or Yoruba wiki should cover African music, Asian music, European music and Women in music, all kinds of music - not just two? (Euro classical and American popular). That's the difference.

As it stands this list is kinda perpetuating bias by having European men centered in the biographies section on a world list. For example - by this list we would create a article on Rubens in Malay - but it would be better to cover Wang Xizhi, considering massive Chinese influence in Malay culture (and this goes for many other countries with Chinese culture - thus since Chinese culture is so widespread - it should be essential to cover a Chinese artist - meanwhile we cover European art with many other artists). This ofcourse would never pass but this is how this list is made better, not by removing our only women - in which we are already under-covered and thus already have perpetuated a bias to the world's coverage of art, encouraging European art over any others and men over women.

The List of Articles every wikipedia should have is different, it should be as global as possible, and as soon as its done im sure it will be used to do comparisons between different wikipedias, to see how developed they are. Different languages might have different lists of vital articles, but all language versions redirect to the same list of articles each wiki should have.

As soon as it hits the limit, people will start looking for the most insignificant topics and make arguments why they are insignificant, or at least less significant than the substitute. Also, there can be diminishing returns which affect different topics differently. Once you got all professionals in sports that are or have been real global household names and covered the most popular kinds of sports, additions get more and more obscure. These diminishing returns are weaker when adding more chemical elements, or more individual countries, because all of them are arguably more important than the 182th sports professional you add. Are there any non-minor people in sports when you already have 181 of them? While we have only 10 living heads of state in the list?\n\n:Of course big deletes need to be discussed, any deletion on the list should have some argument backing it up!

Although there are a few topics, in which the meta list is better. Now, before both lists are complete, it is reasonable to synchronize them in order both lists to have as much proper items, as possible. After the lists are complete, they should develop independently. But now, in the preliminary stage, they have to be synchronized. Several steps should be implemented:\n#Find duplicates in english list and correct them.\n#Optimize structure of both lists to be as much in common, as possible.\n#Find all the articles in meta list, that are not on en-wiki list, and add them into english list.\n#Copy the english list into meta (with some technical changes).\n#Delete the items in the meta-list, that are obviously english-culture biased (e.g. lots of american magazines).\n\nIt is possible, that such synchroniztion should be made several times before the lists are complete.--[[User:Abiyoyo|Abiyoyo]] 15:50, 30 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:This sounds okay with me as long as we don't lose any of the current 'meta' articles.

Generally it would be good to just wait while both lists grow independently. But the reality is that thr EN list grows much faster and this list is neglected. What I propose is not to wait, but to take english list as a point to start from (without loosing articles from meta list of course). Finally, we'll have different lists, but what for to double the preliminary work of gathering the main content? E.g. geography section in EN list is much more better.

If we have quotas, people should compare notability within a topic, not a whole list.--[[User:Abiyoyo|Abiyoyo]] 14:22, 27 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n::I agree. The easiest way to create the quotas is look at the 1000 list and use the same proportions of each topic. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 17:31, 27 October 2011 (UTC)\n:::That's what I was thinking about. For the main topics the quotas should be counted as 1:10. But for the subtopics, the proportion should be 1:9 or 1:9.5, not 1:10, because there are some branches of knowledge, that were not notable enough for 1000 list, but are notable for this list. It's quite reasonable to give them 5-10 percent of this expanded list (e.g. anthropology). There's also a problem, that the structures of the lists are not the same, so some complicated calculations should be made.--[[User:Abiyoyo|Abiyoyo]] 23:20, 29 October 2011 (UTC)\n::::Or maybe the structure of the expanded list should be changed to comply with 1000 list?--[[User:Abiyoyo|Abiyoyo]] 23:28, 29 October 2011 (UTC)\n:::::I'd go even higher than 5-10%...I'd maybe even go as high as 15-20%.

See [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded/Quotas|Table]]. The method was the following:\n**For every section in the expanded list a correponding section in 1000 list was found\n**The 'coefficient of growth' was calculated based on decimal logarithmic function. I.e. 1 article in 1000 list 'grows' to 7 articles in the expanded list; 10 articles grow to 80; 100 grows to 900; 1,000 grows to 10,000.\n**The number of articles in 1000 list were multiplied by the found coefficient, making a rough preliminary quota suggestion.\n**The 'corrected quota ' column is reserved for quota correction, as mechanical multiplication gives sometimes strange result. It have to be corrected manually after discussion.\nThis is only a first step towards quota evaluation. They are rather unballanced.

With the four remaining ''Der Spiegel'' is the only other paper I think of as a major paper of record on an international level (though we might include the ''Times of India'' for example simply for its effect on its internal market).  We should also have an article for \"Wire service,\" though I'm not certain that that three main ones each merit their own article.  And I think we should include ''The Economist''; it's not a national newspaper of record, but it's pervasive and influential to a degree I'm not certain is true even of the WSJ.\n::As things stand in the proposal, we have a proposed quota of 40 mass media articles, and I think we can afford to nominate a few more individual publications or companies, including non-newspapers.  Going beyond strictly print, I think we absolutely need to have Al-Jazeera, Xinhua, and the BBC.

Here the ''Times'' is unsurpassed (founded in 1785) and even the ''Washington Post'' is impressive (1875). ''Le Figaro'', founded 1826, is an obvious candidate. One reason for having several U.S. newspapers is the general nature of their press as having no ''national'' newspapers. I have to say the ''Wall Street Journal'' does not leap to mind as one of three US newspapers; I would have thought ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (founded 1865 under a different name). Germany is a problem, because all their present-day leading newspapers were founded 1945 or later. This is understandable, of course, but means they do not have such a desirable historical scope. It's not enough, really, for a newspaper to have millions of readers if its historical influence is negligible. Top newspapers have influenced events, sometimes in a major way. How about ''Pravda''? [[User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross]] ([[User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk]]) 07:38, 2 April 2012 (UTC)\n:What about more scientific journals such as Nature? newspapers are around now for 300-400 years? 60 years (and still ongoing seems to me as it could be relevant) So I wouldn't want to say that all the papers should be at least 100 years old or something, it should just be the most influential ones over time, with a currently still running one having a higher chance to achieve that same level in the future. Mvg, [[User:Basvb|Basvb]] ([[User talk:Basvb|talk]]) 16:16, 1 May 2012 (UTC)\n::Yes, I agree with your point about still ongoing. Scientific journals are obviously not mass media, and it's difficult to see where they could go except for the overall Science section. The oldest continuing publication is the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' (1665), which is now split into A and B series. The oldest weekly science journal is indeed ''Nature'' (1869). It seems to me quite ludicrous to propose 89 constellations and leave out science journals entirely. In addition to the two mentioned, I would include ''Science'', ''PNAS'', and one journal each from France (''Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences'', 1666) and Germany.

[[User:D1gggg]] added 13 fruits and vegetables after a dispute on Wikidata about objects for species and objects for fruits. In this list we generally have had items connected to species, since that's how most of the Wikipedias have structured their info. I spent an hour trying to find the 13 best (least good) items to remove from the \"Cooking, food and drink\" part of the list, and removed items that didn't have so many iw-links to Wikipedias. Apparently [[User:D1gggg]] didn't think I review that edit carefully enough (how many hours do I need to spend for one edit?), so my edit was undone. So this is basically a Wikidata dispute that has spilled over here, and I don't know how to solve it.

Myspace should be replaced by RT.--[[User:RekishiEJ|RekishiEJ]] ([[User talk:RekishiEJ|talk]]) 09:11, 22 December 2017 (UTC)\n\n:Agree with removing \"Myspace\" for something better.  But I really doubt RT is \"most popular television news network in the Arab world and Latin America\". The most popular television network in Russia is [[:en:Russia-1]] which seems a better choice that RT. Or if we are swapping social media platform for social media platform [[:en:Instragram]] (or just about any Chinese social media) is more popular than anything in the current list. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 07:05, 24 December 2017 (UTC)\n::After skimming the lede of the English Wikipedia article on Myspace I changed my mind, since although Myspace is becoming less and less popular, it was not only once the most largest social networking site on earth and once the most popular website (exceeding Google) in America, but also influenced pop culture and music substantially. I now argue that [[:en:MS-13|MS-13]] should be removed instead, since it is vital only for people living in America, Canada, Mexico and Central America, the list is meant to list 10,000 articles which every Wikipedia should have and make them featured, and the English equivalent list does not contain MS-13 at all, meaning for many smaller Wikipedias it is even less vital. Besides, I think that many more NGOs should be removed from the list, since it seems to me that they are less vital than [[:en:marines|marines]] and [[:en:submachine gun|submachine gun]], and English Wikipedia does not contain them at all. Regarding RT, although I forgot the source which claims that RT Arabic is now the most popular TV news channel in the Arab world and RT Spanish is now the most popular one in Latin America, RT indeed successfully challenges Western media hegemony (cf. [https://sputniknews.com/politics/201703261051975972-sputnik-rt-arab-world/]), and of all news media RT's Youtube channel is the most subscribed one, thus RT is more vital than Russia-1.--[[User:RekishiEJ|RekishiEJ]] ([[User talk:RekishiEJ|talk]]) 17:53, 26 December 2017 (UTC) changed \"marine corps\" to \"marines\" 18:08, 26 December 2017 (UTC)\n\n:::Yeah, I think historical importance is a good justification for Myspace. It is dead now but it was once king of social media. I think judging relative important is a lot easier when finding and replacing entries in the same category. For example, MS-13 is much more important than [[:en:Tom and Jerry|Tom and Jerry]]. Not arguing for either but it is much easier to compare entries in the same topic. --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 10:42, 30 December 2017 (UTC)\n::::MarsRover, you mean you don't argue for keeping MS-13?--[[User:RekishiEJ|RekishiEJ]] ([[User talk:RekishiEJ|talk]]) 09:07, 16 January 2018 (UTC) added \"MarsRover, \" 09:08, 16 January 2018 (UTC)\n\n:::::Yes, I am arguing to keep MS-13 just because RT is a Media topic and MS-13 is an Organization topic. IMHO, we should remove from the same section that we add to so the quotas stay the same. If you want, you can always propose to add another organization and remove another media topic if you really want to add RT and remove MS-13.  --[[en:User:MarsRover|MarsRover]] 03:20, 5 February 2018 (UTC)\n\n== Musicians and composers: not representative ==\n\nThe list of composers is very heavily lopsided towards the \"romantic\" epoch. If you really want to include people like Bruckner (didnt like his own works and kept aimlessly rewriting them), Smetana (important for Czech music, but worldwide? same with Sibelius for Finland, 20th c.), Liszt (superficially virtuosic) or Mussorgsky (had no idea of orchestration) -- then the absence of some of the greatest masters from earlier epochs cannot be excused. The following additions would still result in a very narrow selection that does not remove the imbalance:\n* Renaissance:\n** [[d:Q143100|Josquin Desprez]] (mandatory)\n** [[d:Q154792|Orlando di Lasso]] (mandatory)\n** [[d:Q312615|Adrian Willaert]]\n** [[d:Q207355|John Dowland]]\n* Baroque\n** [[d:Q1192|Jean-Baptiste Lully]] (father of French orchestral music and French opera)\n** [[d:Q1145|Jean Philippe Rameau]] (innovator of French opera and ballet, leading development from baroque to later styles)\n** [[d:Q75854|Georg Philipp Telemann]] (dominated musical life of his time)\n** [[d:Q164475|Arcangelo Corelli]] (small oeuvre but very influential for later chamber & orchestral music; some works are still fairly popular)\nOn the other hand, some quite unknown composers could be weeded out, in addition to some less important romantic ones. I consider myself as more-than-average interested in classical music, but never in my life have I even heard the names of: C\u00e9sar Cui, Harold Arlen, Joe Hisaishi. Alan Parsons is someone capable of assembling sound effects but hardly a \"composer\".  --[[User:Alazon|Alazon]] ([[User talk:Alazon|talk]]) 16:11, 20 January 2018 (UTC)\n:Please help improve the selection.

Categories of most other Wikipedias also add up to 9992, except some (e.g. 9987 for :bnwiki at 60th place). Should I come up with 8 topics to add? \u2014 [[User:Yerpo|Yerpo]] <sup>[[User talk:Yerpo|Eh?]]</sup> 11:12, 14 July 2018 (UTC)\n:I think it's more likely that there is an error in the script. When I count the articles (with another script) I get 10001 items. When I run the list-of-wikipedias-script I got error messages like: \"Q16 has no wikidata item\", and the same error for Q4628, Q1011, Q26988, Q1410, Q1009, Q79, Q16635, and Q1246. All those nine Wikidata items exist, and have lots of links to Wikipedias. 10001-9=9992. Unfortunately I don't have time to investigate and fix the error.

Let me for example quote the lead from [[:en:Anatolia]]: \"Anatolia (from Greek \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae Anatol\u1e17; Turkish: Anadolu \"east\" or \"[sun]rise\"), also known as Asia Minor (Medieval and Modern Greek: \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 Mikr\u00e1 As\u00eda, \"small Asia\"; Turkish: K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Asya), Asian Turkey, the Anatolian peninsula, or the Anatolian plateau...\" I believe thus, that most of the articles should be linked to one of the two, keeping exceptions (like [[:be:\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0456\u044f]]) in the other. --[[User:Deinocheirus|Deinocheirus]] ([[User talk:Deinocheirus|talk]]) 21:11, 18 January 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Suggested changes in the Mathematics and Sports list ==\n\nThere were some massive changes made in the [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded/Mathematics|Mathematics]] and [[List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded/Anthropology, psychology and everyday life|Sports]] lists (5 and 6 items replaced correspondingly). I doubted the value of these changes and reverted the changes.

I've already started drafting a reformatted version of the page, but won't make changes without input.\nI'd like to highlight a few changes that may result from following the style guide.\n\n'''Ordered to bulleted lists:'''\nNumbered lists should only be used when there's a need to refer to the elements by number, the sequence is critical, or if the numbering has some independent meaning. I don't know of any need to refer to these articles by number, so I doubt that there needs to be an ordered list. If there is some reason to keep these lists ordered, tell me.\n\n'''Article order:'''\nLists should all be alphabetized unless some other order makes more sense. For example, it makes the most sense to list chemical elements by atomic number or to list solar system bodies by distance from the Sun. This will be straightforward to fix, though tedious.\n\n'''Personal names:'''\nLists of personal names should be ordered by surname or family name. The list of [[List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Expanded/People|people]] is largely sorted, but largely by ''last'' name as opposed to surname. This is a problem for names which list surnames first. Furthermore, I believe names should be formatted with respect to their language on a case-by-case basis.\n\n'''Lead explanation:'''\nThe introductory material for lists should explain non-obvious characteristics of the list. As far as I can tell, it is unexplained why some items are in bold (I assume this is for which items are in the 1K list, in which case it should be updated) or why some items have an asterisk. These should be addressed in the lead.\n\n'''Wikidata naming:'''\nAnother formatting change that I believe should be made, though not in the style guide, is to match an article's title as it appears here to the title shown first in the article's corresponding Wikidata article.\n\nThese changes will not alter which articles are included nor which section they appear in. The first change I'm working on is to alphabetize/organize the list. These are some big changes I'm proposing, so I'd like to discuss them before actually making any public change. Let me know what you think, or how you'd format the list. --[[User:Megaskizzen|Megaskizzen]] ([[User talk:Megaskizzen|talk]]) 21:49, 22 June 2019 (UTC)\n\n== Piles and piles of pages! ==\n\nI made PagePiles of 10k article sublists, so people can run queries on them in Petscan or use it with other tools - for example, Petscan can give you missing articles in your language etc. Here they are:\n* people: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27256 ID 27256]\n* history: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27100 ID 27100]\n* geography: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27072 ID 27072]\n* arts: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27103 ID 27103]\n* philosophy and religion: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27102 ID 27102]\n* anthropology, psychology and everyday life: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27104 ID 27104]\n* society and social sciences: ID [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27106 ID 27106]\n* biology and health sciences: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27090 ID 27090]\n* physical sciences: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27107 ID 27107]\n* technology: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27108 ID 27108]\n* mathematics: [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pagepile/api.php?action=get_data&format=html&id=27091 ID 27091]\nPlease let me know if you find any mistake, such as missing items.

Persian already has its own entry in the main list, and Kurdish and Pashto are in the expanded list, so the only gap that needs to be covered is Avestan, which can reasonably be introduced in the Zoroastrianism article if needed. On the other hand, the Mongolic language family doesn't have anything exemplifying it, except maybe the Mongols article under Ethnic groups. I'd suggest replacing Altaic with Mongolic instead, but maybe Altaic is useful to keep around as a sort of proxy for discredited linguistic theories like mass comparison.
